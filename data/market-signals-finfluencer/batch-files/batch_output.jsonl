The disclaimer \"Not financial advice\" suggests a cautious approach to providing financial guidance, which is common among influencers who may not have formal qualifications. The content focuses on personal experiences and strategies, which can be informative but may lack the depth and rigor of professional financial analysis.**  \n**value: 40**  \n**speculation: 40**\n\n**question: Which of these areas of finance are the primary focus of the influencer\u2019s posts?**  \n**explanation: The primary focus of Joyee Yang's posts is on personal finance and investing, particularly in stocks and ETFs. The content frequently discusses investment strategies, passive income, and financial products like ETFs, RRSPs, and TFSAs. The use of hashtags such as #investing, #finance, and #stocks further supports this focus.
