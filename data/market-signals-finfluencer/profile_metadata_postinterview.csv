","You are analyzing social media posts to identify individuals who may be finfluencers. A finfluencer is someone who uses their online presence to promote financial products, services, or strategies, often in an engaging and emotionally-driven style. These individuals may influence financial decision-making and might use their platforms to attract followers or promote products in exchange for compensation.

Here are some criteria for identifying the accounts of finfluencers:
· Posts promote specific financial products, services, or platforms (e.g., trading apps, cryptocurrencies, investment courses).
· The tone is promotional or emotionally driven, often including success stories or calls to action (e.g., ""Don't miss out on this opportunity!"").
· Visual elements such as screenshots of profits, bold text, or lifestyle displays implying wealth and success.
· Use of financial buzzwords (e.g., ""passive income,"" ""financial freedom,"" ""crypto gains"").
· May include affiliate links or ambiguous disclaimers (e.g., ""This is not financial advice"").

The price alone doesn't tell you much, but investors can use something called the PE ratio. That stands for price to earnings, and it's one of the stats you can use to value a company across similar companies. Let me explain. For 10, we have a burger shop called Al's Burgers. They trade for $20 per share on the stock market, and their earnings per share is $2. So therefore, investors are currently paying $10 for every $1 of earnings they generate, meaning that's a PE ratio of 10. Now, Bob's Burgers enters the chat, and their share price is also $20. They're actually much more profitable though, and their earnings per share is $4. That means people are currently paying $5 for every $1 of earnings, or a PE ratio of five. So Al's has a much higher stock price relative to how much they actually earn, so that could mean they're overvalued relative to Bob's Burgers. So Bob's is comparably the better deal. PE ratios vary across all types of industries and companies, so you always need to compare within the same industry. In the case of Apple versus Google, Google trades at a 24 PE compared to Apple's 36.98, so there may be an argument that Google is undervalued relatively to Apple. However, there's much more to investing than just one stat, and I'm gonna make more videos on it, so make sure to follow me for more.

Created on 2025-02-13 21:58:00+00:00) Stocks, real estate, or crypto, which one actually builds wealth faster? Let's break it down. For stocks, the S&P 500 has averaged 10% per year since 1925 or the past 100 years or so. Real estate, however, has returned about 4.2% since 1928, according to the latest data from NYU Stern. With real estate, it's more common to use leverage to multiply returns, as well as there are depreciation strategies to increase your overall return as well. Lastly, crypto. Oh boy, Bitcoin has exploded 100,000% since 2010, but of course it comes with a ton of extreme volatility. It experienced a minus 84% drop from December 2017 to December 2018, which wiped out a lot of crypto investors. There are pros and cons to each of these, but which one are you choosing? Let me know in the comments.

It comes down to the idea that demand for gas is what's called inelastic. Gas is an item people buy that just doesn't have many substitutes. When prices of goods go up, the demand for it should decrease. But with inelastic demand, when the price of gas, say, goes up, the quantity demanded just decreases by a smaller percentage. Demand is relatively unresponsive to price changes in the case of gas because people need this item to drive, even if prices go up. Other goods that are like this could include eggs and milk. But what about goods that are elastic? In other words, they act the opposite. These are much more common and refer to anything that you buy much less of just because the price went up. So if price goes up, demand goes down a lot. Examples include luxury cars, designer clothing, airline tickets, or even concerts. Pricing is super fascinating when it comes to business and economics because if you price something incorrectly, your business could fail. But if the price is right, you could thrive.

But a common mistake people make is that they believe that their entire income is now taxed at 22%, leaving them to make less money, which is just not true. Here's how it actually works. In the first tax bracket, any amount of money you make up to $11,925 per year is taxed at 10%. Then the amount of money you make from 11,926 to 48,745 is taxed at 12%. You see, only dollars that you make in that corresponding bracket are taxed at that rate. In the case of the raise, you'll only pay 22% in taxes on any dollars above 48,476. So for a $50,000 salary, that means only 1524 of it is taxed at 22%. The rest of your salary is taxed at those lower rates, giving you an effective total rate of 12.1%. So making more money is always better. If you enjoy videos about finance and investing, follow me for more.

Number one is that investment income is taxed wildly differently than at your job. So if you make $100,000 in investment income, you'll get taxed at long-term capital gains rates or 15%, $15,000. That same $100,000 in a salary job, you're paying 22.4% in total tax. So what does that tell you? You should probably invest. Number two, any Roth retirement accounts. So these are accounts where all your profits that you make are tax-free and they're so overpowered that the government only lets you put in $7,000 per year if you're under the age of 50 or 8K per year over the age of 50. And number three, QBI deductions. America always encourages small businesses and small business owners and certain freelancers can get up to a 20% deduction on business profits. For example, if you make $190,000 in business income through an LLC, sole proprietorship, S Corp, or any entity with a pass-through income, your total tax owed is $29,522. If you made that at a job, you would owe $36,888 on federal income tax alone. So if you're able to understand how the system is set up and how it incentivizes different people to make money, you're going to be much better off. Follow me if you want a part two of this.

And this is typically the largest holding of any portfolio that I start and it's up 80% in the past five years. Next, I would add $200 of QQQ. That's the ETF giving you exposure to tech and software companies. It's done really well in the past five years, plus 128%. Then I would put $300 into individual stocks. So I would choose three stocks and put $100 into each of them. You want companies that will be around in 40 years. So think of your Apples, your Googles, or your JP Morgans of the world. It's important to not buy any penny stocks. My last $100 is staying in a high yield savings account in cash, waiting for opportunities. And I think this split provides a lot of diversification to stocks via ETFs, as well as you get some concentration into stable long-term companies.

Jetsuite X is the airline that lets you fly semi-privately and for this comparison I flew between LA and San Francisco and I started my timer when the airline announced boarding. For my United flight it took 54 minutes after they announced boarding for us to take off and after a 52 minute flight time I finally got out. All right just got out of the plane two hours and five minutes and about four seconds. Before I reveal how much time JSX saves let's look at the fare difference. For United I paid $135 for my flight to LA and Jetsuite X was $299 for one way. So is the time savings worth the cost? We're gonna break that down but first here's how long it took me. It took one hour and 37 minutes on Jetsuite X for the same segment thereby saving me about 28 minutes. Since the fare difference was $163 to save about a half hour if you value your time and around $330 per hour JSX becomes worth it on just the boarding 2D planning process. I'd also estimate you save about an hour each way because you have light security, you can arrive 20 minutes before your flight, and you don't have to navigate any terminals. Of course this is dependent on how early you get to the airport etc but I'm gonna leave up a breakdown of my times in particular and if you like this video make sure to follow me for more.

First, you wanna pick a brokerage you're comfortable with like Fidelity, Schwab, or M1 Finance and click open an account. Click on retirement and IRAs and then right here, you'll wanna choose open a Roth IRA. Then you need to fill out this. It's some basic information like your name, address, et cetera In your IRA dashboard, make sure to click contribute now. Once you connect your bank account, you can contribute to the Roth IRA. Now the contribution limit, I don't know if you can see this is $7,000 per year or $8,000 per year if you're over the age of 50. Personally, I would just automate it with a monthly recurring transaction of around 300 to $500 per month. Once you have some money in your Roth IRA, you wanna buy some index funds that will grow over time. So the S&P 500 has been growing 8% to 10% annually since it was started. Ticker symbols for that include VOO, SPY, FX, AIX, as well as VFIX. If you get average returns in the market for 40 years, your future balance is going to be $2.365 million. And the crazy part is is that you only contributed about $280,000, the rest is your return. Make sure to follow me for more finance videos like these on your page.

Created on 2025-02-04 17:45:24+00:00) This is how much I made in interest in my high yield savings account for the last three months. Now this includes my emergency fund as well as my savings for a down payment on a future house. So I personally keep about six months of expenses in an emergency fund. And for me, that looks like about $30,000 which I know sounds like a little bit on the high end but I like that peace of mind and it's about 5K a month. Then I have about 132K that I've been accumulating over the years as extra money for a down payment or investment property. I don't wanna invest these funds since I actually might need them soon. So therefore it just stays in my high yield account. In February, I made about $577. Now in January, I made $633.05. And in December, I made $630.15. The reason for the decrease recently is that the Federal Reserve lowered their interest rates a couple months ago. So my January interest was a tad lower. Still though, I get about a 4.5% return on my high yield savings through Wealthfront. And I love the fact that I got paid around $1,840 extra these past three months for literally doing nothing, just existing.

Created on 2025-02-03 15:37:35+00:00) President Trump officially imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, as well as 10% on Chinese goods over the weekend. The market today is reacting awfully because of it. As you can see, everything's in the red. Economists have predicted that tariffs will cause inflation and lower GDP growth, but why do tariffs cause inflation and should we be worried? If a toy costs $10 and Walmart imports it from say Canada, Walmart will now have to pay an extra $2.50 to US customs, thus probably passing on that cost likely to customers. A tariff then would incentivize the US based supplier like Walmart to seek out American made toys instead of Canadian ones. This will also hurt Canada and Mexico's economy way more than it hurts the United States, because currently nearly 80% of both Canada and Mexico's exports go to United States. On the US side, about 16% of US exports go to Canada and Mexico respectively. I think this is just a negotiation tactic by Trump because Canada and Mexico won't be able to sustain this for a long period of time. Both of their economies are more reliant on the US than the US is reliant on them. Now, will the real impact of these tariffs last? Well, I definitely could see GDP being affected as well as inflation. However, I do think that Trump knew all of these things going into it. If you're investing for the long term, such as your retirement, I don't think you need to do anything. Don't abandon your investing plans. However, if you are invested for the short term, such as the next few months, I don't think these tariff issues will be solved until at least the end of Q1. What do you think? Let me know in the comments.

Created on 2025-02-02 19:04:09+00:00) If you make $10,000 in profit on Apple stock, do you know how much tax you would have to pay? It depends entirely on how long you hold the stock as well as if you actually sold the stock. You'll owe taxes when you realize the profit, so that's when you actually sell the stock for a gain. So let's say you sell Apple stock and you realize a $10,000 gain in profit. If you held it for less than one year, you will owe short-term capital gains taxes, and that is taxed at your federal marginal tax rate. So if you make $120,000 per year, that puts you in the 24% marginal tax bracket, that means you will owe $2,400 in taxes on the gain of 10,000. If you're able to hold it for more than a year, your long-term capital gains rate then becomes 0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on your income. In this case, you would owe $1,500 in taxes if you sold it after owning it for more than one year. Now, keep in mind, if you just buy and hold and you don't sell at all, then you don't owe any taxes yet. It's only when you sell the stock.

Well, new, it's going to cost you $45,950, but you should never buy it new because after one year, the resale value is 21% less or $36,000. Cars are depreciating assets, which means that they lose value over time. If you Google car depreciation curve, you can see that all of them go downwards, but we can actually use this to save money. To get the most value, we wanna buy a car after the fourth year of depreciation. That's a used car sweet spot. In the case of the BMW, if you wait four years, that car's only gonna cost you $27,000 or about 51% less. I like to buy a car that's three to four years used, maybe has 15 to 20,000 miles on it, and is perhaps a lease turn back, and then I'm gonna buy it in cash. Follow me for more.

Number one is to start a budget and track how much you spend. Now, a good rule of thumb is to use the 50-30-20 rule. That's where 50% of your budget goes towards needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings. Second is to write down your net worth every quarter or every year to see if it's trending in the right direction. Personally, I tally all my bank accounts and investment accounts, and then I subtract any liabilities or debt that I have, and I try to track it on a regular basis. This habit increases your net worth because you're now paying attention to it, and I'll have a free net worth tracker for you guys down below. Number three is to invest your money and get it to work for you. I talk a lot about investing on this page, but by doing so, you're ensuring that your money isn't just sitting there losing value to inflation. If you're just getting started, putting money into index funds like the S&P 500 are a great way to start, so ticker symbols VOO or SPY. Let me know down below your net worth if you're comfortable in the comments.

Assuming you save 10K per year at a 7% return, it takes you 7.84 years to hit your first 100K, but the next 100K, since your money is working for you, would take you 5.1 years. Fast forward, and we can see that all subsequent 100K increments, each one is faster than the previous. You have money working for you and it's continuing to compound, and as you invest, it's like rolling a giant snowball down the hill. Look at the time between the 400K and 500K mark. You can see it's 2.5 years, and comparing that to the first 100K, it's a lot faster, but don't worry, it gets crazier still. By the time you're approaching the $1 million mark from the $900,000 mark, it's only going to take you 1.35 years for that same 100K. The first 100K takes you 25.5% of the total time it takes to get to a million dollars. The remaining 900K only takes 74.5% of the time, so that's pretty funny. It's like when you hit 100K, you're basically a quarter of the way to a million dollars. I know that sounds weird, but in terms of time, it's true.

It's the number one app in the top free apps. They released an AI model last week that basically rivals LLMs like ChadGBT, and it was created for a fraction of the cost. They claim around $6 million. Investors are worried because it was created without access to NVIDIA's most powerful chips, and NVIDIA's growth and share price relies on the AI industry actually needing those chips. Basically, current market and price levels are super reliant on future AI profits as well as the industry growing. DeepSeek is a huge threat to all that because if some startup from China can come in and do it for a very limited budget without the need for these chips, then the entire AI industry is now called into question. I do feel like the stock price of NVIDIA today seems like an overreaction, but valuations were high already, as you can see, and the S&P 500 is still overvalued compared to what it typically is. And some people on the internet don't believe that it only costs $6 million. Personally, I'm a little skeptical as well, but until we find out more, I'm not entirely sure that this is the end of the AI industry just yet.

There are three big reasons why that could happen. Now, the first is lifestyle inflation. So in this book, The Millionaire Next Door, the author found that people who often look well off are usually deeply in debt. Physicians and lawyers, for example, usually earn above average incomes, but they also tend to drive luxury cars and live in larger homes because they want to live in the same neighborhoods that their colleagues do. Common mistake number two is being burdened by too much debt. So if your friend has $5,000 in credit card debt for just one year, that's $5,000 they aren't investing. In that single year alone, that $5,000 could grow to over $50,000 in 30 years. Third, there's a lack of tracking or budgeting the money itself. So it's really easy to spend frivolously without knowing the full repercussions of how much you're spending versus how much you're not. If you track your money, you'll have a clear understanding of where your money is going and you won't be as likely to overspend. Do you know anyone that makes a good income yet they're broke? Let me know down below.

Created on 2025-01-26 00:02:09+00:00) You're gonna make your first 100K, it's not gonna come from investing, and that's something that people don't get. Pretend you get average gains in the market of 8% per year and start with $10,000, it would still take you 30 years to hit $100,000 just investing that sum, and nobody wants to wait that long. Charlie Munger, who was Warren Buffet's right-hand man, said it best, the first $100,000 is a bitch, but you gotta do it, I don't care what you have to do. So your first $100,000 actually comes mostly from saving every dollar and investing on top of that. If you save 12K a year for seven years at a 4.5% return, you will have $100,000, but look, 84% of it came from savings, and only 16% of it came from the interest in gains. A lot of the friction in building wealth is at the beginning of the journey, so every dollar when you're starting out saving matters that much more. I hope this helps.

So you gotta make sure you're protecting your money against inflation, and here are three options. Number one is just investing. The easiest way to beat the inflation rate is to invest in the market. So on average, the stock market returns about eight to 10% per year. And if you invest in index funds, you can buy the entire market just with one purchase. The second are treasury inflation protected securities, also known as TIPS. Now, these are government bonds that adjust their principal value with inflation. These aren't perfect by any means, but currently they provide around a 2.2% return above the inflation rate. Number three, you could consider real estate, which generally appreciates over time. Now, keep in mind that this isn't perfect either, but in general, property values and rental income tend to rise with inflation. As long as your money is working for you somehow, it's better than keeping it in a bank account that yields 0.01%. An easy option anybody can do is a high yield savings account for the time being while they pay about 4% per year.

Created on 2025-01-22 22:12:50+00:00) Everyone tells you to get a Roth IRA, but no one tells you what to invest in. Here are three options to invest in with the riskiest one being last. First option are index funds and ETFs tracking the S&P 500. These are low to medium risk over a long-term time horizon and you'll set it and forget it. And it should on average return about 8 to 10% per year. Second, you could go with a three fund portfolio. That's where you have a US stock market index fund, an international stock market index fund and a bond fund. This is more diversified than the first option. So lower risk in general and is overall a solid choice. Third are individual stocks, especially mega caps. Since the Roth IRA gives you tax-free gains, you wanna take full advantage of that with holdings that have high upside. These are riskier, but having a few positions of companies of the caliber of Apple, Google, or Amazon could be good. $1,000 in Apple stock 20 years ago is worth more than $700,000 today. And if you invested in a Roth IRA, then all of those gains would be tax-free. That's the power of it.

In the 1980s, the DynaTAC was rolled out costing $3,995 and you'd get around 30 minutes of talk time and it's projected that those plans cost a few hundred dollars per month. Now in the 1990s, the Bureau of Labor Statistics cited cell services costing around $50 per month with limited talk time and some data usage. Now in the 2000s, the cost of cell phone services ranged but you could get your phone covered for about $30 per month. As more competitors entered the market, prices went down. However, by the 2010s, the introduction of smartphones and data plans meant that cell phone plans started to cost an average of $113 per month for one line with unlimited data, talk and text. But what if you could pay only $25 per month? Metro offers just that with their BYOD or bring your own phone plan. All you have to do is bring the phone you want to add the service to and pay $25 per month. You get unlimited 5G on one line with no contracts or credit checks.

This is going to be the foundation of your portfolio and it's up 83% in the past five years. Second, I'm adding another $3,000 into QQQ. That's the ETF that gives you exposure to the software and tech companies. And in the past five years, it's up 135%. Third, I'm going to add $2,000 into a high yield savings account. And that way I always have some cash on hand in case there are any opportunities to buy up any dips. Let me know if you have any questions. I'll also have some free downloads in my profile.

Bitcoin is the guy that microdoses LSD for breakfast, he lives in an apartment that looks like this, and one day he's spending 5k at the club, but then the next day he's asking you for money. He talks about changing the system, but he can't even commit to dinner plans. Financial stocks are like artists full of potential, one year they can be flying you around the world because they're mega successful, but then society kind of weighs a little bit heavier on them, they're a little bit sensitive, so when people start to talk bad about them, they go into a dark, deep depression, and their stock price falls because of it too. Gold is the old money guy and talks about legacy, he's reliable in tough times, goes skiing in Aspen, and he's going to be happy when everyone else is miserable. And it's especially true when times are tough in the world.

We are so excited to unveil the Discover List 2025, a list that showcases 50 creators from around the world who are educators who have inspired people to learn something new, or icons who have entertained us with their unique points of view. Every day, creators bring their passion, creativity, and perspective to the platform. Like Cinema Joe, or the Mrs. Kelly, or Bites with Lily, who are a few of the names that you'll find on the list this year. They've turned their ideas into trends, stories into movements, and moments into connections that bring people together. Creators are what make TikTok so special. From the bottom of my heart, congratulations to the creators honored on the Discover List. We cannot wait to see what you create next.

Created on 2025-01-29 18:19:21+00:00) I've loved books ever since I can remember. I got my first library card at the age of five and I was hooked. My name is Michael Threatts. I'm a librarian and a believer in library joy. When I first got on TikTok, I started sharing the librarian life, the story of the library kids and the library grown-ups because it brought me joy every single library shift. I wanted people to see how much happens at the local libraries. Hello there, my friends. My name is Michael. I am blessed to be PBS's resident librarian. Are you Arthur Reed? Yeah, how'd you know? I would recognize those glasses anywhere. Libraries are so much more than books on shelves. Everyone deserves library joy. Sharing library joy on social media has been such a wonderful journey for me. I'm going to be on a library card, wow! I love when people send me pictures and comments and videos and say, Mr. Michael, look, I got my very own library card. I also love that people will message me and they will say, Mr. Michael, thank you for talking about mental health. Whenever I am sad, I watch this librarian Michael's TikToks. He's fostered a love of reading and books in children. And it feels better to come on and talk about libraries than Michael. Michael also represents a certain level of tenderness and acceptance. The world, libraries are so much better with you in them. You need your very own library card, the best card ever. Yes!

Created on 2025-01-28 18:50:51+00:00) I feel that TikTok allows artists to take their music fully into their hands. I'm Gigi Perez and I'm an artist. Everything it contradicts. My little sister, she was really early to TikTok and always made her videos and every now and then I'd get in them. I look back at how much I posted then. Because at this point it was pretty much just covers and every now and then a song. And then my older sister passed away. This one song that I wrote about my sister brought the first seed of connection through my grief. I'll never forget the feeling of not seeing just one or two people who had experienced something similar, but thousands. I think that's what's so amazing about TikTok and the way that it's designed to connect people who otherwise would have never met. Because that saves lives. And it saved mine. Kiss me on the mouth and love me like a sailor. And when you get it, say it's me. Tell me what's the flavor. The first people to grab onto Sailor Song was the younger LGBT community who are struggling with their identity. Struggling with the person that they love. I'll be scrolling on my For You page and I'll see someone on live covering Sailor Song in real time. It's just great to see that people are excited about the music because I'm excited about them. I feel that TikTok allows artists to take their music fully into their hands. That's very powerful and I think for me it was so essential to where I am now.

Created on 2025-01-24 18:17:15+00:00) I just wanted to quickly share what Tik's app means to me. Tik Tok, you have changed my life. Tik Tok has given me some of the best moments of my life. It's changed my life. I am tremendously grateful for this app. I love it. I love coming here. I love creating here. I love connecting here. Tik Tok has propelled me from a farm boy to a international star. The fact that I can help my parents afford retirement is a dream come true. Millennials and Gen Z made a place for themselves. We all find each other on this app. We make a space for new industries. We create jobs. We support small businesses. Tik Tok has been such a source of income and community for me. 98% of my sales come because of this platform. And that's a community I have not been able to replicate anywhere else. Do you guys remember when a small one-man mowing company started a Tik Tok account and began going around in his community to people who had really overgrown yards and taking care of all of their landscaping for free and then successfully fundraised for an old woman in his community? Thank you for allowing me to be myself while I share a part of my life with you guys. And remember divas, stay very demure and very mindful.

Created on 2025-01-23 18:19:26+00:00) I think we were gonna be here today talking about the Dubai Viral Chocolate, probably not. Hi, I'm Sarah, and you may know me as a Dubai Viral Chocolate creator. As a small business, TikTok helped me reach many people around the world. This is the moment that we realized, you know, we went viral, and all of a sudden, you know, you were going from three orders per week to you were getting hundreds and hundreds of orders per second. We were getting messages from people all around the world, from Argentina to South Korea to Poland to Saudi Arabia. We started seeing people recreate our bars at home in different countries. It was an amazing feeling. Probably the most exciting moment for us at Fix was the moment we collaborated with His Royal Highness, the Crown Prince of Dubai. Collaborating with him has been such an honor. Thank you so much for taking the time to discover Fix, and thank you all for your support around the world.

Created on 2025-01-17 17:27:47+00:00) Hi everyone, it's Xiu here. As you know, we have been fighting to protect the constitutional right to free speech for the more than 170 million Americans who use our platform every day to connect, create, discover, and achieve their dreams. On behalf of everyone at TikTok and all our users across the country, I want to thank President Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States. This is a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship. As we've said, TikTok is a place where people can create communities, discover new interests, and express themselves, including over 7 million American businesses who are in the living and gain new customers using our platform. We are grateful and pleased to have the support of a president who truly understands our platform, one who has used TikTok to express his own thoughts and perspectives, connecting with the world, and generating more than 60 billion views of his content in the process. To all American users, thank you for making our TikTok community such a rich and vibrant space, for surprising and delighting us every day. Rest assured, we will do everything in our power to ensure our platform thrives as your online home for limitless creativity and discovery, as well as a source of inspiration and joy for years to come. Thank you, more to come.

Created on 2025-01-16 22:49:21+00:00) TikTok single-handedly changed my life. I want to thank you for giving me a platform to share my story on how I live with Parkinson's disease. It had its entertaining moments. It had its gut-wrenching moments. I was diagnosed with an incurable illness. I thought it was kind of funny to make light of my situation. But one of you guys took that video very seriously. And that person's name is Savannah. I received Savannah's kidney. It is a sacrifice I will never take for granted. As a platform, TikTok has taught me so much more than other platforms. Through it all, there was always a video or a creator who would make something. And I'm like, oh my God, I thought I was the only one. Because of the app, I paid off all my debt. And ever since then, I've been living the best life I can ever live. I'm a 72-year-old woman and 24-7 caretaker for my husband. TikTok is my outlet. It's been a wonderful way to have some kind of connection and community. No, this will not be replicated anywhere else. What TikTok is doing is 100% unique. And if TikTok goes away, everything that we've built together will also go away. I've generated some awareness for Parkinson's, for fitness. Gave me the opportunity to educate millions of women about how to be better with money. And I'm so glad that this app brought us together. These are people using their skills, using their creativity, using their labor to help other people. And then thousands, tens of thousands, millions of other people saying, yeah, I really appreciate what you're doing and I wanna help. Thank you because my life changed thanks to TikTok.

Created on 2025-01-16 15:02:43+00:00) community. And when I say community, I don't say that lightly, has changed my entire life. No one is talking about the more than 7 million small business owners in the United States. We're using Tick Tock shop as their route to market. 2023 alone, Tick Tock added more than 200,000 jobs to the US economy and contributed more than $24 billion. His app saved bookstores. It saved small businesses. It's saved restaurants. I can tell you as a small business owner, Tick Tock has been completely life changing for us. There's hundreds of thousands of people on here that make a living just off of Tick Tock. I'm just overwhelmed with gratitude as I'm going to drop off all of these orders. Y'all support has truly changed my family's life. Our first vile video took off and we sold more sweatshirts in one week than we had in the entire year and a half prior. Me being able to quit my nine to five and go full time with my small business. I have to owe a lot of that to Tick Tock. It's been absolutely wild to see how Tick Tock has made our nerdy pottery mug company successful. I've spent like five years on here building up my brand and my Tick Tock and my small business. This thing has been paying my bills because of you guys. Like that's insane. I found the people all across the United States who wanted to buy my product. It was like magic. What is going to happen to all these small businesses if that goes away overnight? Creators like for example, Keith Lee, going and reviewing restaurants and changing people's lives. A pizza shop that was on the verge of closing, literally a week away from closing, is still open to this day. The owner of a woman owned banana pudding shop in the middle of Texas was on live crying about how she literally couldn't pay her bills or feed her family.

This just isn't about our business. It's about the fundamental rights that makes our nation great. Our story embodies the American dream. My wife and I built Love & Pebble from the ground up, using TikTok to share our passion and connect with people, with Americans, all across this great nation. I have a two-year-old daughter, and when I look at my daughter, I think about the America that I want her to inherit. Do we want to teach the next generation that the solution to our challenges is to restrict freedom rather than protect it? The First Amendment is not a relic of the past. It's a living promise that must be defended in the digital age. Love & Pebble's stance here represents more than just our family's dream. It represents the dreams of countless American entrepreneurs who deserve the right to choose how they reach their customers and share their stories. My daughter deserves to grow up in America where entrepreneurship thrives, where speech remains free, and where the government protects rather than restricts our constitutional rights. That's the America I'm fighting for, and that's the America I want my daughter to inherit. So I pray that the Supreme Court hears the voices of myself and the millions of Americans, protects our First Amendment right to use the platform of my choice, and to save TikTok. Thank you.

","You are analyzing social media posts to identify individuals who may be finfluencers. A finfluencer is someone who uses their online presence to promote financial products, services, or strategies, often in an engaging and emotionally-driven style. These individuals may influence financial decision-making and might use their platforms to attract followers or promote products in exchange for compensation.

Here are some criteria for identifying the accounts of finfluencers:
· Posts promote specific financial products, services, or platforms (e.g., trading apps, cryptocurrencies, investment courses).
· The tone is promotional or emotionally driven, often including success stories or calls to action (e.g., ""Don't miss out on this opportunity!"").
· Visual elements such as screenshots of profits, bold text, or lifestyle displays implying wealth and success.
· Use of financial buzzwords (e.g., ""passive income,"" ""financial freedom,"" ""crypto gains"").
· May include affiliate links or ambiguous disclaimers (e.g., ""This is not financial advice"").

The price alone doesn't tell you much, but investors can use something called the PE ratio. That stands for price to earnings, and it's one of the stats you can use to value a company across similar companies. Let me explain. For 10, we have a burger shop called Al's Burgers. They trade for $20 per share on the stock market, and their earnings per share is $2. So therefore, investors are currently paying $10 for every $1 of earnings they generate, meaning that's a PE ratio of 10. Now, Bob's Burgers enters the chat, and their share price is also $20. They're actually much more profitable though, and their earnings per share is $4. That means people are currently paying $5 for every $1 of earnings, or a PE ratio of five. So Al's has a much higher stock price relative to how much they actually earn, so that could mean they're overvalued relative to Bob's Burgers. So Bob's is comparably the better deal. PE ratios vary across all types of industries and companies, so you always need to compare within the same industry. In the case of Apple versus Google, Google trades at a 24 PE compared to Apple's 36.98, so there may be an argument that Google is undervalued relatively to Apple. However, there's much more to investing than just one stat, and I'm gonna make more videos on it, so make sure to follow me for more.

Created on 2025-02-13 21:58:00+00:00) Stocks, real estate, or crypto, which one actually builds wealth faster? Let's break it down. For stocks, the S&P 500 has averaged 10% per year since 1925 or the past 100 years or so. Real estate, however, has returned about 4.2% since 1928, according to the latest data from NYU Stern. With real estate, it's more common to use leverage to multiply returns, as well as there are depreciation strategies to increase your overall return as well. Lastly, crypto. Oh boy, Bitcoin has exploded 100,000% since 2010, but of course it comes with a ton of extreme volatility. It experienced a minus 84% drop from December 2017 to December 2018, which wiped out a lot of crypto investors. There are pros and cons to each of these, but which one are you choosing? Let me know in the comments.

It comes down to the idea that demand for gas is what's called inelastic. Gas is an item people buy that just doesn't have many substitutes. When prices of goods go up, the demand for it should decrease. But with inelastic demand, when the price of gas, say, goes up, the quantity demanded just decreases by a smaller percentage. Demand is relatively unresponsive to price changes in the case of gas because people need this item to drive, even if prices go up. Other goods that are like this could include eggs and milk. But what about goods that are elastic? In other words, they act the opposite. These are much more common and refer to anything that you buy much less of just because the price went up. So if price goes up, demand goes down a lot. Examples include luxury cars, designer clothing, airline tickets, or even concerts. Pricing is super fascinating when it comes to business and economics because if you price something incorrectly, your business could fail. But if the price is right, you could thrive.

But a common mistake people make is that they believe that their entire income is now taxed at 22%, leaving them to make less money, which is just not true. Here's how it actually works. In the first tax bracket, any amount of money you make up to $11,925 per year is taxed at 10%. Then the amount of money you make from 11,926 to 48,745 is taxed at 12%. You see, only dollars that you make in that corresponding bracket are taxed at that rate. In the case of the raise, you'll only pay 22% in taxes on any dollars above 48,476. So for a $50,000 salary, that means only 1524 of it is taxed at 22%. The rest of your salary is taxed at those lower rates, giving you an effective total rate of 12.1%. So making more money is always better. If you enjoy videos about finance and investing, follow me for more.

Number one is that investment income is taxed wildly differently than at your job. So if you make $100,000 in investment income, you'll get taxed at long-term capital gains rates or 15%, $15,000. That same $100,000 in a salary job, you're paying 22.4% in total tax. So what does that tell you? You should probably invest. Number two, any Roth retirement accounts. So these are accounts where all your profits that you make are tax-free and they're so overpowered that the government only lets you put in $7,000 per year if you're under the age of 50 or 8K per year over the age of 50. And number three, QBI deductions. America always encourages small businesses and small business owners and certain freelancers can get up to a 20% deduction on business profits. For example, if you make $190,000 in business income through an LLC, sole proprietorship, S Corp, or any entity with a pass-through income, your total tax owed is $29,522. If you made that at a job, you would owe $36,888 on federal income tax alone. So if you're able to understand how the system is set up and how it incentivizes different people to make money, you're going to be much better off. Follow me if you want a part two of this.

Created on 2025-02-07 22:45:50+00:00) This is how I would invest $1,000 if I were starting from scratch. First, I'd invest $400 into an S&P 500 ETF like VOO or SPY. And this is typically the largest holding of any portfolio that I start and it's up 80% in the past five years. Next, I would add $200 of QQQ. That's the ETF giving you exposure to tech and software companies. It's done really well in the past five years, plus 128%. Then I would put $300 into individual stocks. So I would choose three stocks and put $100 into each of them. You want companies that will be around in 40 years. So think of your Apples, your Googles, or your JP Morgans of the world. It's important to not buy any penny stocks. My last $100 is staying in a high yield savings account in cash, waiting for opportunities. And I think this split provides a lot of diversification to stocks via ETFs, as well as you get some concentration into stable long-term companies.

Jetsuite X is the airline that lets you fly semi-privately and for this comparison I flew between LA and San Francisco and I started my timer when the airline announced boarding. For my United flight it took 54 minutes after they announced boarding for us to take off and after a 52 minute flight time I finally got out. All right just got out of the plane two hours and five minutes and about four seconds. Before I reveal how much time JSX saves let's look at the fare difference. For United I paid $135 for my flight to LA and Jetsuite X was $299 for one way. So is the time savings worth the cost? We're gonna break that down but first here's how long it took me. It took one hour and 37 minutes on Jetsuite X for the same segment thereby saving me about 28 minutes. Since the fare difference was $163 to save about a half hour if you value your time and around $330 per hour JSX becomes worth it on just the boarding 2D planning process. I'd also estimate you save about an hour each way because you have light security, you can arrive 20 minutes before your flight, and you don't have to navigate any terminals. Of course this is dependent on how early you get to the airport etc but I'm gonna leave up a breakdown of my times in particular and if you like this video make sure to follow me for more.

First, you wanna pick a brokerage you're comfortable with like Fidelity, Schwab, or M1 Finance and click open an account. Click on retirement and IRAs and then right here, you'll wanna choose open a Roth IRA. Then you need to fill out this. It's some basic information like your name, address, et cetera In your IRA dashboard, make sure to click contribute now. Once you connect your bank account, you can contribute to the Roth IRA. Now the contribution limit, I don't know if you can see this is $7,000 per year or $8,000 per year if you're over the age of 50. Personally, I would just automate it with a monthly recurring transaction of around 300 to $500 per month. Once you have some money in your Roth IRA, you wanna buy some index funds that will grow over time. So the S&P 500 has been growing 8% to 10% annually since it was started. Ticker symbols for that include VOO, SPY, FX, AIX, as well as VFIX. If you get average returns in the market for 40 years, your future balance is going to be $2.365 million. And the crazy part is is that you only contributed about $280,000, the rest is your return. Make sure to follow me for more finance videos like these on your page.

Created on 2025-02-04 17:45:24+00:00) This is how much I made in interest in my high yield savings account for the last three months. Now this includes my emergency fund as well as my savings for a down payment on a future house. So I personally keep about six months of expenses in an emergency fund. And for me, that looks like about $30,000 which I know sounds like a little bit on the high end but I like that peace of mind and it's about 5K a month. Then I have about 132K that I've been accumulating over the years as extra money for a down payment or investment property. I don't wanna invest these funds since I actually might need them soon. So therefore it just stays in my high yield account. In February, I made about $577. Now in January, I made $633.05. And in December, I made $630.15. The reason for the decrease recently is that the Federal Reserve lowered their interest rates a couple months ago. So my January interest was a tad lower. Still though, I get about a 4.5% return on my high yield savings through Wealthfront. And I love the fact that I got paid around $1,840 extra these past three months for literally doing nothing, just existing.

Created on 2025-02-03 15:37:35+00:00) President Trump officially imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, as well as 10% on Chinese goods over the weekend. The market today is reacting awfully because of it. As you can see, everything's in the red. Economists have predicted that tariffs will cause inflation and lower GDP growth, but why do tariffs cause inflation and should we be worried? If a toy costs $10 and Walmart imports it from say Canada, Walmart will now have to pay an extra $2.50 to US customs, thus probably passing on that cost likely to customers. A tariff then would incentivize the US based supplier like Walmart to seek out American made toys instead of Canadian ones. This will also hurt Canada and Mexico's economy way more than it hurts the United States, because currently nearly 80% of both Canada and Mexico's exports go to United States. On the US side, about 16% of US exports go to Canada and Mexico respectively. I think this is just a negotiation tactic by Trump because Canada and Mexico won't be able to sustain this for a long period of time. Both of their economies are more reliant on the US than the US is reliant on them. Now, will the real impact of these tariffs last? Well, I definitely could see GDP being affected as well as inflation. However, I do think that Trump knew all of these things going into it. If you're investing for the long term, such as your retirement, I don't think you need to do anything. Don't abandon your investing plans. However, if you are invested for the short term, such as the next few months, I don't think these tariff issues will be solved until at least the end of Q1. What do you think? Let me know in the comments.

Created on 2025-02-02 19:04:09+00:00) If you make $10,000 in profit on Apple stock, do you know how much tax you would have to pay? It depends entirely on how long you hold the stock as well as if you actually sold the stock. You'll owe taxes when you realize the profit, so that's when you actually sell the stock for a gain. So let's say you sell Apple stock and you realize a $10,000 gain in profit. If you held it for less than one year, you will owe short-term capital gains taxes, and that is taxed at your federal marginal tax rate. So if you make $120,000 per year, that puts you in the 24% marginal tax bracket, that means you will owe $2,400 in taxes on the gain of 10,000. If you're able to hold it for more than a year, your long-term capital gains rate then becomes 0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on your income. In this case, you would owe $1,500 in taxes if you sold it after owning it for more than one year. Now, keep in mind, if you just buy and hold and you don't sell at all, then you don't owe any taxes yet. It's only when you sell the stock.

Well, new, it's going to cost you $45,950, but you should never buy it new because after one year, the resale value is 21% less or $36,000. Cars are depreciating assets, which means that they lose value over time. If you Google car depreciation curve, you can see that all of them go downwards, but we can actually use this to save money. To get the most value, we wanna buy a car after the fourth year of depreciation. That's a used car sweet spot. In the case of the BMW, if you wait four years, that car's only gonna cost you $27,000 or about 51% less. I like to buy a car that's three to four years used, maybe has 15 to 20,000 miles on it, and is perhaps a lease turn back, and then I'm gonna buy it in cash. Follow me for more.

Number one is to start a budget and track how much you spend. Now, a good rule of thumb is to use the 50-30-20 rule. That's where 50% of your budget goes towards needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings. Second is to write down your net worth every quarter or every year to see if it's trending in the right direction. Personally, I tally all my bank accounts and investment accounts, and then I subtract any liabilities or debt that I have, and I try to track it on a regular basis. This habit increases your net worth because you're now paying attention to it, and I'll have a free net worth tracker for you guys down below. Number three is to invest your money and get it to work for you. I talk a lot about investing on this page, but by doing so, you're ensuring that your money isn't just sitting there losing value to inflation. If you're just getting started, putting money into index funds like the S&P 500 are a great way to start, so ticker symbols VOO or SPY. Let me know down below your net worth if you're comfortable in the comments.

Created on 2025-01-28 21:20:44+00:00) If you're able to make your first 100K, the next 100K is a lot easier. Assuming you save 10K per year at a 7% return, it takes you 7.84 years to hit your first 100K, but the next 100K, since your money is working for you, would take you 5.1 years. Fast forward, and we can see that all subsequent 100K increments, each one is faster than the previous. You have money working for you and it's continuing to compound, and as you invest, it's like rolling a giant snowball down the hill. Look at the time between the 400K and 500K mark. You can see it's 2.5 years, and comparing that to the first 100K, it's a lot faster, but don't worry, it gets crazier still. By the time you're approaching the $1 million mark from the $900,000 mark, it's only going to take you 1.35 years for that same 100K. The first 100K takes you 25.5% of the total time it takes to get to a million dollars. The remaining 900K only takes 74.5% of the time, so that's pretty funny. It's like when you hit 100K, you're basically a quarter of the way to a million dollars. I know that sounds weird, but in terms of time, it's true.

It's the number one app in the top free apps. They released an AI model last week that basically rivals LLMs like ChadGBT, and it was created for a fraction of the cost. They claim around $6 million. Investors are worried because it was created without access to NVIDIA's most powerful chips, and NVIDIA's growth and share price relies on the AI industry actually needing those chips. Basically, current market and price levels are super reliant on future AI profits as well as the industry growing. DeepSeek is a huge threat to all that because if some startup from China can come in and do it for a very limited budget without the need for these chips, then the entire AI industry is now called into question. I do feel like the stock price of NVIDIA today seems like an overreaction, but valuations were high already, as you can see, and the S&P 500 is still overvalued compared to what it typically is. And some people on the internet don't believe that it only costs $6 million. Personally, I'm a little skeptical as well, but until we find out more, I'm not entirely sure that this is the end of the AI industry just yet.

There are three big reasons why that could happen. Now, the first is lifestyle inflation. So in this book, The Millionaire Next Door, the author found that people who often look well off are usually deeply in debt. Physicians and lawyers, for example, usually earn above average incomes, but they also tend to drive luxury cars and live in larger homes because they want to live in the same neighborhoods that their colleagues do. Common mistake number two is being burdened by too much debt. So if your friend has $5,000 in credit card debt for just one year, that's $5,000 they aren't investing. In that single year alone, that $5,000 could grow to over $50,000 in 30 years. Third, there's a lack of tracking or budgeting the money itself. So it's really easy to spend frivolously without knowing the full repercussions of how much you're spending versus how much you're not. If you track your money, you'll have a clear understanding of where your money is going and you won't be as likely to overspend. Do you know anyone that makes a good income yet they're broke? Let me know down below.

Pretend you get average gains in the market of 8% per year and start with $10,000, it would still take you 30 years to hit $100,000 just investing that sum, and nobody wants to wait that long. Charlie Munger, who was Warren Buffet's right-hand man, said it best, the first $100,000 is a bitch, but you gotta do it, I don't care what you have to do. So your first $100,000 actually comes mostly from saving every dollar and investing on top of that. If you save 12K a year for seven years at a 4.5% return, you will have $100,000, but look, 84% of it came from savings, and only 16% of it came from the interest in gains. A lot of the friction in building wealth is at the beginning of the journey, so every dollar when you're starting out saving matters that much more. I hope this helps.

So you gotta make sure you're protecting your money against inflation, and here are three options. Number one is just investing. The easiest way to beat the inflation rate is to invest in the market. So on average, the stock market returns about eight to 10% per year. And if you invest in index funds, you can buy the entire market just with one purchase. The second are treasury inflation protected securities, also known as TIPS. Now, these are government bonds that adjust their principal value with inflation. These aren't perfect by any means, but currently they provide around a 2.2% return above the inflation rate. Number three, you could consider real estate, which generally appreciates over time. Now, keep in mind that this isn't perfect either, but in general, property values and rental income tend to rise with inflation. As long as your money is working for you somehow, it's better than keeping it in a bank account that yields 0.01%. An easy option anybody can do is a high yield savings account for the time being while they pay about 4% per year.

First option are index funds and ETFs tracking the S&P 500. These are low to medium risk over a long-term time horizon and you'll set it and forget it. And it should on average return about 8 to 10% per year. Second, you could go with a three fund portfolio. That's where you have a US stock market index fund, an international stock market index fund and a bond fund. This is more diversified than the first option. So lower risk in general and is overall a solid choice. Third are individual stocks, especially mega caps. Since the Roth IRA gives you tax-free gains, you wanna take full advantage of that with holdings that have high upside. These are riskier, but having a few positions of companies of the caliber of Apple, Google, or Amazon could be good. $1,000 in Apple stock 20 years ago is worth more than $700,000 today. And if you invested in a Roth IRA, then all of those gains would be tax-free. That's the power of it.

In the 1980s, the DynaTAC was rolled out costing $3,995 and you'd get around 30 minutes of talk time and it's projected that those plans cost a few hundred dollars per month. Now in the 1990s, the Bureau of Labor Statistics cited cell services costing around $50 per month with limited talk time and some data usage. Now in the 2000s, the cost of cell phone services ranged but you could get your phone covered for about $30 per month. As more competitors entered the market, prices went down. However, by the 2010s, the introduction of smartphones and data plans meant that cell phone plans started to cost an average of $113 per month for one line with unlimited data, talk and text. But what if you could pay only $25 per month? Metro offers just that with their BYOD or bring your own phone plan. All you have to do is bring the phone you want to add the service to and pay $25 per month. You get unlimited 5G on one line with no contracts or credit checks.

This is going to be the foundation of your portfolio and it's up 83% in the past five years. Second, I'm adding another $3,000 into QQQ. That's the ETF that gives you exposure to the software and tech companies. And in the past five years, it's up 135%. Third, I'm going to add $2,000 into a high yield savings account. And that way I always have some cash on hand in case there are any opportunities to buy up any dips. Let me know if you have any questions. I'll also have some free downloads in my profile.

Bitcoin is the guy that microdoses LSD for breakfast, he lives in an apartment that looks like this, and one day he's spending 5k at the club, but then the next day he's asking you for money. He talks about changing the system, but he can't even commit to dinner plans. Financial stocks are like artists full of potential, one year they can be flying you around the world because they're mega successful, but then society kind of weighs a little bit heavier on them, they're a little bit sensitive, so when people start to talk bad about them, they go into a dark, deep depression, and their stock price falls because of it too. Gold is the old money guy and talks about legacy, he's reliable in tough times, goes skiing in Aspen, and he's going to be happy when everyone else is miserable. And it's especially true when times are tough in the world.

I'm a librarian and a believer in library joy. When I first got on TikTok, I started sharing the librarian life, the story of the library kids and the library grown-ups because it brought me joy every single library shift. I wanted people to see how much happens at the local libraries. Hello there, my friends. My name is Michael. I am blessed to be PBS's resident librarian. Are you Arthur Reed? Yeah, how'd you know? I would recognize those glasses anywhere. Libraries are so much more than books on shelves. Everyone deserves library joy. Sharing library joy on social media has been such a wonderful journey for me. I'm going to be on a library card, wow! I love when people send me pictures and comments and videos and say, Mr. Michael, look, I got my very own library card. I also love that people will message me and they will say, Mr. Michael, thank you for talking about mental health. Whenever I am sad, I watch this librarian Michael's TikToks. He's fostered a love of reading and books in children. And it feels better to come on and talk about libraries than Michael. Michael also represents a certain level of tenderness and acceptance. The world, libraries are so much better with you in them. You need your very own library card, the best card ever. Yes!

My little sister, she was really early to TikTok and always made her videos and every now and then I'd get in them. I look back at how much I posted then. Because at this point it was pretty much just covers and every now and then a song. And then my older sister passed away. This one song that I wrote about my sister brought the first seed of connection through my grief. I'll never forget the feeling of not seeing just one or two people who had experienced something similar, but thousands. I think that's what's so amazing about TikTok and the way that it's designed to connect people who otherwise would have never met. Because that saves lives. And it saved mine. Kiss me on the mouth and love me like a sailor. And when you get it, say it's me. Tell me what's the flavor. The first people to grab onto Sailor Song was the younger LGBT community who are struggling with their identity. Struggling with the person that they love. I'll be scrolling on my For You page and I'll see someone on live covering Sailor Song in real time. It's just great to see that people are excited about the music because I'm excited about them. I feel that TikTok allows artists to take their music fully into their hands. That's very powerful and I think for me it was so essential to where I am now.

Created on 2025-01-24 18:17:15+00:00) I just wanted to quickly share what Tik's app means to me. Tik Tok, you have changed my life. Tik Tok has given me some of the best moments of my life. It's changed my life. I am tremendously grateful for this app. I love it. I love coming here. I love creating here. I love connecting here. Tik Tok has propelled me from a farm boy to a international star. The fact that I can help my parents afford retirement is a dream come true. Millennials and Gen Z made a place for themselves. We all find each other on this app. We make a space for new industries. We create jobs. We support small businesses. Tik Tok has been such a source of income and community for me. 98% of my sales come because of this platform. And that's a community I have not been able to replicate anywhere else. Do you guys remember when a small one-man mowing company started a Tik Tok account and began going around in his community to people who had really overgrown yards and taking care of all of their landscaping for free and then successfully fundraised for an old woman in his community? Thank you for allowing me to be myself while I share a part of my life with you guys. And remember divas, stay very demure and very mindful.

As a small business, TikTok helped me reach many people around the world. This is the moment that we realized, you know, we went viral, and all of a sudden, you know, you were going from three orders per week to you were getting hundreds and hundreds of orders per second. We were getting messages from people all around the world, from Argentina to South Korea to Poland to Saudi Arabia. We started seeing people recreate our bars at home in different countries. It was an amazing feeling. Probably the most exciting moment for us at Fix was the moment we collaborated with His Royal Highness, the Crown Prince of Dubai. Collaborating with him has been such an honor. Thank you so much for taking the time to discover Fix, and thank you all for your support around the world.

As you know, we have been fighting to protect the constitutional right to free speech for the more than 170 million Americans who use our platform every day to connect, create, discover, and achieve their dreams. On behalf of everyone at TikTok and all our users across the country, I want to thank President Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States. This is a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship. As we've said, TikTok is a place where people can create communities, discover new interests, and express themselves, including over 7 million American businesses who are in the living and gain new customers using our platform. We are grateful and pleased to have the support of a president who truly understands our platform, one who has used TikTok to express his own thoughts and perspectives, connecting with the world, and generating more than 60 billion views of his content in the process. To all American users, thank you for making our TikTok community such a rich and vibrant space, for surprising and delighting us every day. Rest assured, we will do everything in our power to ensure our platform thrives as your online home for limitless creativity and discovery, as well as a source of inspiration and joy for years to come. Thank you, more to come.

It had its entertaining moments. It had its gut-wrenching moments. I was diagnosed with an incurable illness. I thought it was kind of funny to make light of my situation. But one of you guys took that video very seriously. And that person's name is Savannah. I received Savannah's kidney. It is a sacrifice I will never take for granted. As a platform, TikTok has taught me so much more than other platforms. Through it all, there was always a video or a creator who would make something. And I'm like, oh my God, I thought I was the only one. Because of the app, I paid off all my debt. And ever since then, I've been living the best life I can ever live. I'm a 72-year-old woman and 24-7 caretaker for my husband. TikTok is my outlet. It's been a wonderful way to have some kind of connection and community. No, this will not be replicated anywhere else. What TikTok is doing is 100% unique. And if TikTok goes away, everything that we've built together will also go away. I've generated some awareness for Parkinson's, for fitness. Gave me the opportunity to educate millions of women about how to be better with money. And I'm so glad that this app brought us together. These are people using their skills, using their creativity, using their labor to help other people. And then thousands, tens of thousands, millions of other people saying, yeah, I really appreciate what you're doing and I wanna help. Thank you because my life changed thanks to TikTok.

No one is talking about the more than 7 million small business owners in the United States. We're using Tick Tock shop as their route to market. 2023 alone, Tick Tock added more than 200,000 jobs to the US economy and contributed more than $24 billion. His app saved bookstores. It saved small businesses. It's saved restaurants. I can tell you as a small business owner, Tick Tock has been completely life changing for us. There's hundreds of thousands of people on here that make a living just off of Tick Tock. I'm just overwhelmed with gratitude as I'm going to drop off all of these orders. Y'all support has truly changed my family's life. Our first vile video took off and we sold more sweatshirts in one week than we had in the entire year and a half prior. Me being able to quit my nine to five and go full time with my small business. I have to owe a lot of that to Tick Tock. It's been absolutely wild to see how Tick Tock has made our nerdy pottery mug company successful. I've spent like five years on here building up my brand and my Tick Tock and my small business. This thing has been paying my bills because of you guys. Like that's insane. I found the people all across the United States who wanted to buy my product. It was like magic. What is going to happen to all these small businesses if that goes away overnight? Creators like for example, Keith Lee, going and reviewing restaurants and changing people's lives. A pizza shop that was on the verge of closing, literally a week away from closing, is still open to this day. The owner of a woman owned banana pudding shop in the middle of Texas was on live crying about how she literally couldn't pay her bills or feed her family. She's opened a second location and nothing or nobody is going to stop me from doing that.

Created on 2025-01-15 00:14:09+00:00) As the co-founder of Love & Pebble, a small business built on the foundation of American entrepreneurship, I pray that the Supreme Court of America does what is right in protecting us. This just isn't about our business. It's about the fundamental rights that makes our nation great. Our story embodies the American dream. My wife and I built Love & Pebble from the ground up, using TikTok to share our passion and connect with people, with Americans, all across this great nation. I have a two-year-old daughter, and when I look at my daughter, I think about the America that I want her to inherit. Do we want to teach the next generation that the solution to our challenges is to restrict freedom rather than protect it? The First Amendment is not a relic of the past. It's a living promise that must be defended in the digital age. Love & Pebble's stance here represents more than just our family's dream. It represents the dreams of countless American entrepreneurs who deserve the right to choose how they reach their customers and share their stories. My daughter deserves to grow up in America where entrepreneurship thrives, where speech remains free, and where the government protects rather than restricts our constitutional rights. That's the America I'm fighting for, and that's the America I want my daughter to inherit. So I pray that the Supreme Court hears the voices of myself and the millions of Americans, protects our First Amendment right to use the platform of my choice, and to save TikTok. Thank you.

Mommy, mommy, a girl behind you. Mamma mia, c'è una ragazza dietro di te. This is your cool girl summer. Like, brat means iconic. You're giving brat summer. Brat summer is over, besties. I'm looking for a man in finance with a trust fund. Six-five, low eyes. I'm looking for a new book boyfriend. This is a message for all the guys trying to talk to my girl. Scram! I said, scram!

Created on 2025-02-12 21:35:07+00:00) Hello everyone, I'm Kim Farrell, and I'm the Global Head of Creators here at TikTok. We are so excited to unveil the Discover List 2025, a list that showcases 50 creators from around the world who are educators who have inspired people to learn something new, or icons who have entertained us with their unique points of view. Every day, creators bring their passion, creativity, and perspective to the platform. Like Cinema Joe, or the Mrs. Kelly, or Bites with Lily, who are a few of the names that you'll find on the list this year. They've turned their ideas into trends, stories into movements, and moments into connections that bring people together. Creators are what make TikTok so special. From the bottom of my heart, congratulations to the creators honored on the Discover List. We cannot wait to see what you create next.

So everybody who's ever supported, just show up in droves and show them how much they meant to the community. Now I'm coming all the way from the Bronx. I saw there was a buffalo chicken pizza that everybody was talking about. So I'm definitely going to get that one. Thank you to everybody that's been supporting my father.

You can do that by enhancing your privacy settings. If you're a parent of a teen like me, you can also enable safeguards for your teen through features like family pairing. And while you're here, we wanna share more about the steps that we take every day to keep the platform safe and secure, including investments in trust and safety, our special safeguards for teens, and more information about how the For You feed works.

The TikTok community brought all these different type of fans to my music. There's been over a million videos on TikTok made to your song. That's nuts. You can make a million songs, and if they don't get supported, it's not going anywhere. It's really cool, and I think we're discovering way more art because of it. Search Grammy's on TikTok to watch Off The Record, Grammy's edition. Grammy's. Grammy's.

Created on 2025-01-29 18:19:21+00:00) I've loved books ever since I can remember. I got my first library card at the age of five and I was hooked. My name is Michael Threatts. I'm a librarian and a believer in library joy. When I first got on TikTok, I started sharing the librarian life, the story of the library kids and the library grown-ups because it brought me joy every single library shift. I wanted people to see how much happens at the local libraries. Hello there, my friends. My name is Michael. I am blessed to be PBS's resident librarian. Are you Arthur Reed? Yeah, how'd you know? I would recognize those glasses anywhere. Libraries are so much more than books on shelves. Everyone deserves library joy. Sharing library joy on social media has been such a wonderful journey for me. I'm going to be on a library card, wow! I love when people send me pictures and comments and videos and say, Mr. Michael, look, I got my very own library card. I also love that people will message me and they will say, Mr. Michael, thank you for talking about mental health. Whenever I am sad, I watch this librarian Michael's TikToks. He's fostered a love of reading and books in children. And it feels better to come on and talk about libraries than Michael. Michael also represents a certain level of tenderness and acceptance. The world, libraries are so much better with you in them. You need your very own library card, the best card ever. Yes!

Created on 2025-01-28 18:50:51+00:00) I feel that TikTok allows artists to take their music fully into their hands. I'm Gigi Perez and I'm an artist. Everything it contradicts. My little sister, she was really early to TikTok and always made her videos and every now and then I'd get in them. I look back at how much I posted then. Because at this point it was pretty much just covers and every now and then a song. And then my older sister passed away. This one song that I wrote about my sister brought the first seed of connection through my grief. I'll never forget the feeling of not seeing just one or two people who had experienced something similar, but thousands. I think that's what's so amazing about TikTok and the way that it's designed to connect people who otherwise would have never met. Because that saves lives. And it saved mine. Kiss me on the mouth and love me like a sailor. And when you get it, say it's me. Tell me what's the flavor. The first people to grab onto Sailor Song was the younger LGBT community who are struggling with their identity. Struggling with the person that they love. I'll be scrolling on my For You page and I'll see someone on live covering Sailor Song in real time. It's just great to see that people are excited about the music because I'm excited about them. I feel that TikTok allows artists to take their music fully into their hands. That's very powerful and I think for me it was so essential to where I am now.

Created on 2025-01-24 18:17:15+00:00) I just wanted to quickly share what Tik's app means to me. Tik Tok, you have changed my life. Tik Tok has given me some of the best moments of my life. It's changed my life. I am tremendously grateful for this app. I love it. I love coming here. I love creating here. I love connecting here. Tik Tok has propelled me from a farm boy to a international star. The fact that I can help my parents afford retirement is a dream come true. Millennials and Gen Z made a place for themselves. We all find each other on this app. We make a space for new industries. We create jobs. We support small businesses. Tik Tok has been such a source of income and community for me. 98% of my sales come because of this platform. And that's a community I have not been able to replicate anywhere else. Do you guys remember when a small one-man mowing company started a Tik Tok account and began going around in his community to people who had really overgrown yards and taking care of all of their landscaping for free and then successfully fundraised for an old woman in his community? Thank you for allowing me to be myself while I share a part of my life with you guys. And remember divas, stay very demure and very mindful.

Created on 2025-01-23 18:19:26+00:00) I think we were gonna be here today talking about the Dubai Viral Chocolate, probably not. Hi, I'm Sarah, and you may know me as a Dubai Viral Chocolate creator. As a small business, TikTok helped me reach many people around the world. This is the moment that we realized, you know, we went viral, and all of a sudden, you know, you were going from three orders per week to you were getting hundreds and hundreds of orders per second. We were getting messages from people all around the world, from Argentina to South Korea to Poland to Saudi Arabia. We started seeing people recreate our bars at home in different countries. It was an amazing feeling. Probably the most exciting moment for us at Fix was the moment we collaborated with His Royal Highness, the Crown Prince of Dubai. Collaborating with him has been such an honor. Thank you so much for taking the time to discover Fix, and thank you all for your support around the world.

Created on 2025-01-17 17:27:47+00:00) Hi everyone, it's Xiu here. As you know, we have been fighting to protect the constitutional right to free speech for the more than 170 million Americans who use our platform every day to connect, create, discover, and achieve their dreams. On behalf of everyone at TikTok and all our users across the country, I want to thank President Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States. This is a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship. As we've said, TikTok is a place where people can create communities, discover new interests, and express themselves, including over 7 million American businesses who are in the living and gain new customers using our platform. We are grateful and pleased to have the support of a president who truly understands our platform, one who has used TikTok to express his own thoughts and perspectives, connecting with the world, and generating more than 60 billion views of his content in the process. To all American users, thank you for making our TikTok community such a rich and vibrant space, for surprising and delighting us every day. Rest assured, we will do everything in our power to ensure our platform thrives as your online home for limitless creativity and discovery, as well as a source of inspiration and joy for years to come. Thank you, more to come.

Created on 2025-01-16 22:49:21+00:00) TikTok single-handedly changed my life. I want to thank you for giving me a platform to share my story on how I live with Parkinson's disease. It had its entertaining moments. It had its gut-wrenching moments. I was diagnosed with an incurable illness. I thought it was kind of funny to make light of my situation. But one of you guys took that video very seriously. And that person's name is Savannah. I received Savannah's kidney. It is a sacrifice I will never take for granted. As a platform, TikTok has taught me so much more than other platforms. Through it all, there was always a video or a creator who would make something. And I'm like, oh my God, I thought I was the only one. Because of the app, I paid off all my debt. And ever since then, I've been living the best life I can ever live. I'm a 72-year-old woman and 24-7 caretaker for my husband. TikTok is my outlet. It's been a wonderful way to have some kind of connection and community. No, this will not be replicated anywhere else. What TikTok is doing is 100% unique. And if TikTok goes away, everything that we've built together will also go away. I've generated some awareness for Parkinson's, for fitness. Gave me the opportunity to educate millions of women about how to be better with money. And I'm so glad that this app brought us together. These are people using their skills, using their creativity, using their labor to help other people. And then thousands, tens of thousands, millions of other people saying, yeah, I really appreciate what you're doing and I wanna help. Thank you because my life changed thanks to TikTok.

Created on 2025-01-16 15:02:43+00:00) community. And when I say community, I don't say that lightly, has changed my entire life. No one is talking about the more than 7 million small business owners in the United States. We're using Tick Tock shop as their route to market. 2023 alone, Tick Tock added more than 200,000 jobs to the US economy and contributed more than $24 billion. His app saved bookstores. It saved small businesses. It's saved restaurants. I can tell you as a small business owner, Tick Tock has been completely life changing for us. There's hundreds of thousands of people on here that make a living just off of Tick Tock. I'm just overwhelmed with gratitude as I'm going to drop off all of these orders. Y'all support has truly changed my family's life. Our first vile video took off and we sold more sweatshirts in one week than we had in the entire year and a half prior. Me being able to quit my nine to five and go full time with my small business. I have to owe a lot of that to Tick Tock. It's been absolutely wild to see how Tick Tock has made our nerdy pottery mug company successful. I've spent like five years on here building up my brand and my Tick Tock and my small business. This thing has been paying my bills because of you guys. Like that's insane. I found the people all across the United States who wanted to buy my product. It was like magic. What is going to happen to all these small businesses if that goes away overnight? Creators like for example, Keith Lee, going and reviewing restaurants and changing people's lives. A pizza shop that was on the verge of closing, literally a week away from closing, is still open to this day. The owner of a woman owned banana pudding shop in the middle of Texas was on live crying about how she literally couldn't pay her bills or feed her family. She's opened a second location and nothing or nobody is going to stop me from doing that.

Created on 2025-01-15 00:14:09+00:00) As the co-founder of Love & Pebble, a small business built on the foundation of American entrepreneurship, I pray that the Supreme Court of America does what is right in protecting us. This just isn't about our business. It's about the fundamental rights that makes our nation great. Our story embodies the American dream. My wife and I built Love & Pebble from the ground up, using TikTok to share our passion and connect with people, with Americans, all across this great nation. I have a two-year-old daughter, and when I look at my daughter, I think about the America that I want her to inherit. Do we want to teach the next generation that the solution to our challenges is to restrict freedom rather than protect it? The First Amendment is not a relic of the past. It's a living promise that must be defended in the digital age. Love & Pebble's stance here represents more than just our family's dream. It represents the dreams of countless American entrepreneurs who deserve the right to choose how they reach their customers and share their stories. My daughter deserves to grow up in America where entrepreneurship thrives, where speech remains free, and where the government protects rather than restricts our constitutional rights. That's the America I'm fighting for, and that's the America I want my daughter to inherit. So I pray that the Supreme Court hears the voices of myself and the millions of Americans, protects our First Amendment right to use the platform of my choice, and to save TikTok. Thank you.

Mommy, mommy, a girl behind you. Mamma mia, c'è una ragazza dietro di te. This is your cool girl summer. Like, brat means iconic. You're giving brat summer. Brat summer is over, besties. I'm looking for a man in finance with a trust fund. Six-five, low eyes. I'm looking for a new book boyfriend. This is a message for all the guys trying to talk to my girl. Scram! I said, scram!

The price alone doesn't tell you much, but investors can use something called the PE ratio. That stands for price to earnings, and it's one of the stats you can use to value a company across similar companies. Let me explain. For 10, we have a burger shop called Al's Burgers. They trade for $20 per share on the stock market, and their earnings per share is $2. So therefore, investors are currently paying $10 for every $1 of earnings they generate, meaning that's a PE ratio of 10. Now, Bob's Burgers enters the chat, and their share price is also $20. They're actually much more profitable though, and their earnings per share is $4. That means people are currently paying $5 for every $1 of earnings, or a PE ratio of five. So Al's has a much higher stock price relative to how much they actually earn, so that could mean they're overvalued relative to Bob's Burgers. So Bob's is comparably the better deal. PE ratios vary across all types of industries and companies, so you always need to compare within the same industry. In the case of Apple versus Google, Google trades at a 24 PE compared to Apple's 36.98, so there may be an argument that Google is undervalued relatively to Apple. However, there's much more to investing than just one stat, and I'm gonna make more videos on it, so make sure to follow me for more.

Created on 2025-02-13 21:58:00+00:00) Stocks, real estate, or crypto, which one actually builds wealth faster? Let's break it down. For stocks, the S&P 500 has averaged 10% per year since 1925 or the past 100 years or so. Real estate, however, has returned about 4.2% since 1928, according to the latest data from NYU Stern. With real estate, it's more common to use leverage to multiply returns, as well as there are depreciation strategies to increase your overall return as well. Lastly, crypto. Oh boy, Bitcoin has exploded 100,000% since 2010, but of course it comes with a ton of extreme volatility. It experienced a minus 84% drop from December 2017 to December 2018, which wiped out a lot of crypto investors. There are pros and cons to each of these, but which one are you choosing? Let me know in the comments.

It comes down to the idea that demand for gas is what's called inelastic. Gas is an item people buy that just doesn't have many substitutes. When prices of goods go up, the demand for it should decrease. But with inelastic demand, when the price of gas, say, goes up, the quantity demanded just decreases by a smaller percentage. Demand is relatively unresponsive to price changes in the case of gas because people need this item to drive, even if prices go up. Other goods that are like this could include eggs and milk. But what about goods that are elastic? In other words, they act the opposite. These are much more common and refer to anything that you buy much less of just because the price went up. So if price goes up, demand goes down a lot. Examples include luxury cars, designer clothing, airline tickets, or even concerts. Pricing is super fascinating when it comes to business and economics because if you price something incorrectly, your business could fail. But if the price is right, you could thrive.

But a common mistake people make is that they believe that their entire income is now taxed at 22%, leaving them to make less money, which is just not true. Here's how it actually works. In the first tax bracket, any amount of money you make up to $11,925 per year is taxed at 10%. Then the amount of money you make from 11,926 to 48,745 is taxed at 12%. You see, only dollars that you make in that corresponding bracket are taxed at that rate. In the case of the raise, you'll only pay 22% in taxes on any dollars above 48,476. So for a $50,000 salary, that means only 1524 of it is taxed at 22%. The rest of your salary is taxed at those lower rates, giving you an effective total rate of 12.1%. So making more money is always better. If you enjoy videos about finance and investing, follow me for more.

Number one is that investment income is taxed wildly differently than at your job. So if you make $100,000 in investment income, you'll get taxed at long-term capital gains rates or 15%, $15,000. That same $100,000 in a salary job, you're paying 22.4% in total tax. So what does that tell you? You should probably invest. Number two, any Roth retirement accounts. So these are accounts where all your profits that you make are tax-free and they're so overpowered that the government only lets you put in $7,000 per year if you're under the age of 50 or 8K per year over the age of 50. And number three, QBI deductions. America always encourages small businesses and small business owners and certain freelancers can get up to a 20% deduction on business profits. For example, if you make $190,000 in business income through an LLC, sole proprietorship, S Corp, or any entity with a pass-through income, your total tax owed is $29,522. If you made that at a job, you would owe $36,888 on federal income tax alone. So if you're able to understand how the system is set up and how it incentivizes different people to make money, you're going to be much better off. Follow me if you want a part two of this.

And this is typically the largest holding of any portfolio that I start and it's up 80% in the past five years. Next, I would add $200 of QQQ. That's the ETF giving you exposure to tech and software companies. It's done really well in the past five years, plus 128%. Then I would put $300 into individual stocks. So I would choose three stocks and put $100 into each of them. You want companies that will be around in 40 years. So think of your Apples, your Googles, or your JP Morgans of the world. It's important to not buy any penny stocks. My last $100 is staying in a high yield savings account in cash, waiting for opportunities. And I think this split provides a lot of diversification to stocks via ETFs, as well as you get some concentration into stable long-term companies.

Jetsuite X is the airline that lets you fly semi-privately and for this comparison I flew between LA and San Francisco and I started my timer when the airline announced boarding. For my United flight it took 54 minutes after they announced boarding for us to take off and after a 52 minute flight time I finally got out. All right just got out of the plane two hours and five minutes and about four seconds. Before I reveal how much time JSX saves let's look at the fare difference. For United I paid $135 for my flight to LA and Jetsuite X was $299 for one way. So is the time savings worth the cost? We're gonna break that down but first here's how long it took me. It took one hour and 37 minutes on Jetsuite X for the same segment thereby saving me about 28 minutes. Since the fare difference was $163 to save about a half hour if you value your time and around $330 per hour JSX becomes worth it on just the boarding 2D planning process. I'd also estimate you save about an hour each way because you have light security, you can arrive 20 minutes before your flight, and you don't have to navigate any terminals. Of course this is dependent on how early you get to the airport etc but I'm gonna leave up a breakdown of my times in particular and if you like this video make sure to follow me for more.

First, you wanna pick a brokerage you're comfortable with like Fidelity, Schwab, or M1 Finance and click open an account. Click on retirement and IRAs and then right here, you'll wanna choose open a Roth IRA. Then you need to fill out this. It's some basic information like your name, address, et cetera In your IRA dashboard, make sure to click contribute now. Once you connect your bank account, you can contribute to the Roth IRA. Now the contribution limit, I don't know if you can see this is $7,000 per year or $8,000 per year if you're over the age of 50. Personally, I would just automate it with a monthly recurring transaction of around 300 to $500 per month. Once you have some money in your Roth IRA, you wanna buy some index funds that will grow over time. So the S&P 500 has been growing 8% to 10% annually since it was started. Ticker symbols for that include VOO, SPY, FX, AIX, as well as VFIX. If you get average returns in the market for 40 years, your future balance is going to be $2.365 million. And the crazy part is is that you only contributed about $280,000, the rest is your return. Make sure to follow me for more finance videos like these on your page.

Created on 2025-02-04 17:45:24+00:00) This is how much I made in interest in my high yield savings account for the last three months. Now this includes my emergency fund as well as my savings for a down payment on a future house. So I personally keep about six months of expenses in an emergency fund. And for me, that looks like about $30,000 which I know sounds like a little bit on the high end but I like that peace of mind and it's about 5K a month. Then I have about 132K that I've been accumulating over the years as extra money for a down payment or investment property. I don't wanna invest these funds since I actually might need them soon. So therefore it just stays in my high yield account. In February, I made about $577. Now in January, I made $633.05. And in December, I made $630.15. The reason for the decrease recently is that the Federal Reserve lowered their interest rates a couple months ago. So my January interest was a tad lower. Still though, I get about a 4.5% return on my high yield savings through Wealthfront. And I love the fact that I got paid around $1,840 extra these past three months for literally doing nothing, just existing.

Created on 2025-02-03 15:37:35+00:00) President Trump officially imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, as well as 10% on Chinese goods over the weekend. The market today is reacting awfully because of it. As you can see, everything's in the red. Economists have predicted that tariffs will cause inflation and lower GDP growth, but why do tariffs cause inflation and should we be worried? If a toy costs $10 and Walmart imports it from say Canada, Walmart will now have to pay an extra $2.50 to US customs, thus probably passing on that cost likely to customers. A tariff then would incentivize the US based supplier like Walmart to seek out American made toys instead of Canadian ones. This will also hurt Canada and Mexico's economy way more than it hurts the United States, because currently nearly 80% of both Canada and Mexico's exports go to United States. On the US side, about 16% of US exports go to Canada and Mexico respectively. I think this is just a negotiation tactic by Trump because Canada and Mexico won't be able to sustain this for a long period of time. Both of their economies are more reliant on the US than the US is reliant on them. Now, will the real impact of these tariffs last? Well, I definitely could see GDP being affected as well as inflation. However, I do think that Trump knew all of these things going into it. If you're investing for the long term, such as your retirement, I don't think you need to do anything. Don't abandon your investing plans. However, if you are invested for the short term, such as the next few months, I don't think these tariff issues will be solved until at least the end of Q1. What do you think? Let me know in the comments.

It depends entirely on how long you hold the stock as well as if you actually sold the stock. You'll owe taxes when you realize the profit, so that's when you actually sell the stock for a gain. So let's say you sell Apple stock and you realize a $10,000 gain in profit. If you held it for less than one year, you will owe short-term capital gains taxes, and that is taxed at your federal marginal tax rate. So if you make $120,000 per year, that puts you in the 24% marginal tax bracket, that means you will owe $2,400 in taxes on the gain of 10,000. If you're able to hold it for more than a year, your long-term capital gains rate then becomes 0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on your income. In this case, you would owe $1,500 in taxes if you sold it after owning it for more than one year. Now, keep in mind, if you just buy and hold and you don't sell at all, then you don't owe any taxes yet. It's only when you sell the stock.

Well, new, it's going to cost you $45,950, but you should never buy it new because after one year, the resale value is 21% less or $36,000. Cars are depreciating assets, which means that they lose value over time. If you Google car depreciation curve, you can see that all of them go downwards, but we can actually use this to save money. To get the most value, we wanna buy a car after the fourth year of depreciation. That's a used car sweet spot. In the case of the BMW, if you wait four years, that car's only gonna cost you $27,000 or about 51% less. I like to buy a car that's three to four years used, maybe has 15 to 20,000 miles on it, and is perhaps a lease turn back, and then I'm gonna buy it in cash. Follow me for more.

Number one is to start a budget and track how much you spend. Now, a good rule of thumb is to use the 50-30-20 rule. That's where 50% of your budget goes towards needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings. Second is to write down your net worth every quarter or every year to see if it's trending in the right direction. Personally, I tally all my bank accounts and investment accounts, and then I subtract any liabilities or debt that I have, and I try to track it on a regular basis. This habit increases your net worth because you're now paying attention to it, and I'll have a free net worth tracker for you guys down below. Number three is to invest your money and get it to work for you. I talk a lot about investing on this page, but by doing so, you're ensuring that your money isn't just sitting there losing value to inflation. If you're just getting started, putting money into index funds like the S&P 500 are a great way to start, so ticker symbols VOO or SPY. Let me know down below your net worth if you're comfortable in the comments.

Assuming you save 10K per year at a 7% return, it takes you 7.84 years to hit your first 100K, but the next 100K, since your money is working for you, would take you 5.1 years. Fast forward, and we can see that all subsequent 100K increments, each one is faster than the previous. You have money working for you and it's continuing to compound, and as you invest, it's like rolling a giant snowball down the hill. Look at the time between the 400K and 500K mark. You can see it's 2.5 years, and comparing that to the first 100K, it's a lot faster, but don't worry, it gets crazier still. By the time you're approaching the $1 million mark from the $900,000 mark, it's only going to take you 1.35 years for that same 100K. The first 100K takes you 25.5% of the total time it takes to get to a million dollars. The remaining 900K only takes 74.5% of the time, so that's pretty funny. It's like when you hit 100K, you're basically a quarter of the way to a million dollars. I know that sounds weird, but in terms of time, it's true.

It's the number one app in the top free apps. They released an AI model last week that basically rivals LLMs like ChadGBT, and it was created for a fraction of the cost. They claim around $6 million. Investors are worried because it was created without access to NVIDIA's most powerful chips, and NVIDIA's growth and share price relies on the AI industry actually needing those chips. Basically, current market and price levels are super reliant on future AI profits as well as the industry growing. DeepSeek is a huge threat to all that because if some startup from China can come in and do it for a very limited budget without the need for these chips, then the entire AI industry is now called into question. I do feel like the stock price of NVIDIA today seems like an overreaction, but valuations were high already, as you can see, and the S&P 500 is still overvalued compared to what it typically is. And some people on the internet don't believe that it only costs $6 million. Personally, I'm a little skeptical as well, but until we find out more, I'm not entirely sure that this is the end of the AI industry just yet.

There are three big reasons why that could happen. Now, the first is lifestyle inflation. So in this book, The Millionaire Next Door, the author found that people who often look well off are usually deeply in debt. Physicians and lawyers, for example, usually earn above average incomes, but they also tend to drive luxury cars and live in larger homes because they want to live in the same neighborhoods that their colleagues do. Common mistake number two is being burdened by too much debt. So if your friend has $5,000 in credit card debt for just one year, that's $5,000 they aren't investing. In that single year alone, that $5,000 could grow to over $50,000 in 30 years. Third, there's a lack of tracking or budgeting the money itself. So it's really easy to spend frivolously without knowing the full repercussions of how much you're spending versus how much you're not. If you track your money, you'll have a clear understanding of where your money is going and you won't be as likely to overspend. Do you know anyone that makes a good income yet they're broke? Let me know down below.

Pretend you get average gains in the market of 8% per year and start with $10,000, it would still take you 30 years to hit $100,000 just investing that sum, and nobody wants to wait that long. Charlie Munger, who was Warren Buffet's right-hand man, said it best, the first $100,000 is a bitch, but you gotta do it, I don't care what you have to do. So your first $100,000 actually comes mostly from saving every dollar and investing on top of that. If you save 12K a year for seven years at a 4.5% return, you will have $100,000, but look, 84% of it came from savings, and only 16% of it came from the interest in gains. A lot of the friction in building wealth is at the beginning of the journey, so every dollar when you're starting out saving matters that much more. I hope this helps.

So you gotta make sure you're protecting your money against inflation, and here are three options. Number one is just investing. The easiest way to beat the inflation rate is to invest in the market. So on average, the stock market returns about eight to 10% per year. And if you invest in index funds, you can buy the entire market just with one purchase. The second are treasury inflation protected securities, also known as TIPS. Now, these are government bonds that adjust their principal value with inflation. These aren't perfect by any means, but currently they provide around a 2.2% return above the inflation rate. Number three, you could consider real estate, which generally appreciates over time. Now, keep in mind that this isn't perfect either, but in general, property values and rental income tend to rise with inflation. As long as your money is working for you somehow, it's better than keeping it in a bank account that yields 0.01%. An easy option anybody can do is a high yield savings account for the time being while they pay about 4% per year.

First option are index funds and ETFs tracking the S&P 500. These are low to medium risk over a long-term time horizon and you'll set it and forget it. And it should on average return about 8 to 10% per year. Second, you could go with a three fund portfolio. That's where you have a US stock market index fund, an international stock market index fund and a bond fund. This is more diversified than the first option. So lower risk in general and is overall a solid choice. Third are individual stocks, especially mega caps. Since the Roth IRA gives you tax-free gains, you wanna take full advantage of that with holdings that have high upside. These are riskier, but having a few positions of companies of the caliber of Apple, Google, or Amazon could be good. $1,000 in Apple stock 20 years ago is worth more than $700,000 today. And if you invested in a Roth IRA, then all of those gains would be tax-free. That's the power of it.

In the 1980s, the DynaTAC was rolled out costing $3,995 and you'd get around 30 minutes of talk time and it's projected that those plans cost a few hundred dollars per month. Now in the 1990s, the Bureau of Labor Statistics cited cell services costing around $50 per month with limited talk time and some data usage. Now in the 2000s, the cost of cell phone services ranged but you could get your phone covered for about $30 per month. As more competitors entered the market, prices went down. However, by the 2010s, the introduction of smartphones and data plans meant that cell phone plans started to cost an average of $113 per month for one line with unlimited data, talk and text. But what if you could pay only $25 per month? Metro offers just that with their BYOD or bring your own phone plan. All you have to do is bring the phone you want to add the service to and pay $25 per month. You get unlimited 5G on one line with no contracts or credit checks.

Created on 2025-01-21 19:37:15+00:00) is how I would invest $10,000 if I were starting all over again. First, I'd invest $5,000 into an S&P 500 ETF like VOO or SPY. This is going to be the foundation of your portfolio and it's up 83% in the past five years. Second, I'm adding another $3,000 into QQQ. That's the ETF that gives you exposure to the software and tech companies. And in the past five years, it's up 135%. Third, I'm going to add $2,000 into a high yield savings account. And that way I always have some cash on hand in case there are any opportunities to buy up any dips. Let me know if you have any questions. I'll also have some free downloads in my profile.

Bitcoin is the guy that microdoses LSD for breakfast, he lives in an apartment that looks like this, and one day he's spending 5k at the club, but then the next day he's asking you for money. He talks about changing the system, but he can't even commit to dinner plans. Financial stocks are like artists full of potential, one year they can be flying you around the world because they're mega successful, but then society kind of weighs a little bit heavier on them, they're a little bit sensitive, so when people start to talk bad about them, they go into a dark, deep depression, and their stock price falls because of it too. Gold is the old money guy and talks about legacy, he's reliable in tough times, goes skiing in Aspen, and he's going to be happy when everyone else is miserable. And it's especially true when times are tough in the world.

Pak Willy lihat ini aja, bawah juga udah pada rusak. Atas udah pada rusak. Bolong-bolong. Bolong-bolong. Sama meja-meja udah pada raku. Kalau harga sih saya kurang tahu.

Emang kalau biasanya nggak ya, Bu? Bocoran, Kak. Pak Willy, aku pengen dipasangin lampu. Oh gitu. Berapa tuh, Bu? Kira-kira 10 juta. Biar anak-anak kalau misalnya mendung nggak kegelatan.

Selama ini kami guru-guru pada patungan. Padahal gaji perbulan kami cuma 400 ribu. Nggak cukup dong? Iya, dicukup-cukupin, Kak. Buat apa aja itu? Buat alat-alat sekolah, topang tulis.

Keren loh. Exfoliating AHA, BHA, PHA serum with DNA Salmon. Benar yang merah. Rambungannya udah bagus banget. Betul. Ectoin Ceramide itu juga the best. The best. Buat serum. Tadi dokter Oki aja kaget, kagum. Kok bisa ada packaging kayak gini nih? Iya, aku udah tadi tuh... Dari awal dateng bunda mau ini terus. Karena packagingnya aku jujur belum pernah lihat. Di Indonesia belum ada ya. Karena unik banget ya guys. Jadi dia ada kayak merah satu, terus putih satu. Jadi beda. Jadi kalian beda hari, beda serum. Tapi dalam satu tempat. Jadi itu irit sebenarnya. Murah dan ini bagus banget. Kita kalau ngeliat serum tuh biasanya ngeliat dari teksturnya. Terus wanginya. Terus wanginya dan kandungannya. Nih, aku pake bagus banget di tangan kiri sama kanan aja tuh keliatan. Dia tuh kayak kenyal, moist dan kayak beda gitu. Aku kalau kandungannya tuh bagus tuh beda.

Created on 2025-02-02 01:44:28+00:00) Jika dokter Oki ketagihan, cobain wait nanti. Karena isi kandungannya bagus banget. Ada kandungan niasinemite-nya, memudarkan bekas-bekas misalnya ada bekas-bekas kehitaman di badannya, kulitnya belang, misalnya kebakar sinar matahari, sunburn. Nah ini bisa mengembalikan warna kulit kalian, warna kulit aslinya balik. Plus mencerahkan, nge-glowing-in kulitnya lagi, naik bisa tone up kulitnya 1-2 tingkat. Bener, ini kalau aku langsung pake aja misalnya dok. Tadi udah pake nih dokter Oki ya, ini untuk lembapin kulitnya kita. Langsung nyerap nih, real ya. Dan ini ada tone up-nya. Tapi tone up-nya gak lebay. Lembap, wangi, bersih, bisa mencerahkan. Makanya... Ini enak banget. Ini body lotion-nya udah dokter detektif approve juga. Bener, dokter Oki juga approve ini, bagus. Langsung dipake loh ini. Gak ngedempul. Bagus di kulit, langsung menyerap. Gak buat kulit abu-abu. Aromanya menenangkan. Enak banget, mencerahkan. Apalagi ini kualitasnya bagus. Ini saya saranin kalian beli aja gak usah pake mikir.

Pak Willy lihat ini aja, bawah juga udah pada rusak. Atas udah pada rusak. Bolong-bolong. Bolong-bolong. Sama meja-meja udah pada raku. Kalau harga sih saya kurang tahu. Mungkin kurang lebih 100 juta untuk biaya keramik. Masang proton. Dan juga untuk bangku-bangku yang sudah pada rusak. Biar kalau hujan airnya nggak masuk dan anak-anak juga masih tetap belajar. Emang kalau biasanya nggak ya, Bu? Bocoran, Kak. Pak Willy, aku pengen dipasangin lampu. Oh gitu. Berapa tuh, Bu? Kira-kira 10 juta. Biar anak-anak kalau misalnya mendung nggak kegelatan. Sama minta dibikinin WC. Biar anak-anak tuh nggak bayar keluarga. Oh, emang kalau buang air bayar? Bayar, Kak. 2 ribu. Lumayan juga. Tiap hari. Beneran, Kak. Mahal juga dong. Selama ini kami guru-guru pada patungan. Padahal gaji perbulan kami cuma 400 ribu. Nggak cukup dong? Iya, dicukup-cukupin, Kak. Buat apa aja itu? Buat alat-alat sekolah, topang tulis. Ibu jangan nangis lagi dong. Udah pokoknya, Ibu. Adik tenang aja. Saya pasti bantu. Pokoknya saya selalu ingat. Sebaik-baiknya manusia, iyalah bermanfaat untuk orang lain. Amin. Amin ya, Bu. Siap semuanya? Siap!

Ini emang campur awatanah ya, Bu? Ini keramiknya pada pecah-pecah. Ya, mohonlah minta kabuli bantuannya. Biar sekolah kami gak dihina terus sama orang. Emang dihina, Bu? Iya, sama sekolah lain. Tapi walaupun sekolah seperti ini, setiap ada perlombaan, pasti mendapatkan piala. Oh iya? Cuman pialanya saya yang tuh hancur tuh. Kenapa? Lemarinya, Kak. Gak apa-apa. Perjuangan anak-anak kami.

Keren loh. Exfoliating AHA, BHA, PHA serum with DNA Salmon. Benar yang merah. Rambungannya udah bagus banget. Betul. Ectoin Ceramide itu juga the best. The best. Buat serum. Tadi dokter Oki aja kaget, kagum. Kok bisa ada packaging kayak gini nih? Iya, aku udah tadi tuh... Dari awal dateng bunda mau ini terus. Karena packagingnya aku jujur belum pernah lihat. Di Indonesia belum ada ya. Karena unik banget ya guys. Jadi dia ada kayak merah satu, terus putih satu. Jadi beda. Jadi kalian beda hari, beda serum. Tapi dalam satu tempat. Jadi itu irit sebenarnya. Murah dan ini bagus banget. Kita kalau ngeliat serum tuh biasanya ngeliat dari teksturnya. Terus wanginya. Terus wanginya dan kandungannya. Nih, aku pake bagus banget di tangan kiri sama kanan aja tuh keliatan. Dia tuh kayak kenyal, moist dan kayak beda gitu. Aku kalau kandungannya tuh bagus tuh beda.

Created on 2025-02-02 01:44:28+00:00) Jika dokter Oki ketagihan, cobain wait nanti. Karena isi kandungannya bagus banget. Ada kandungan niasinemite-nya, memudarkan bekas-bekas misalnya ada bekas-bekas kehitaman di badannya, kulitnya belang, misalnya kebakar sinar matahari, sunburn. Nah ini bisa mengembalikan warna kulit kalian, warna kulit aslinya balik. Plus mencerahkan, nge-glowing-in kulitnya lagi, naik bisa tone up kulitnya 1-2 tingkat. Bener, ini kalau aku langsung pake aja misalnya dok. Tadi udah pake nih dokter Oki ya, ini untuk lembapin kulitnya kita. Langsung nyerap nih, real ya. Dan ini ada tone up-nya. Tapi tone up-nya gak lebay. Lembap, wangi, bersih, bisa mencerahkan. Makanya... Ini enak banget. Ini body lotion-nya udah dokter detektif approve juga. Bener, dokter Oki juga approve ini, bagus. Langsung dipake loh ini. Gak ngedempul. Bagus di kulit, langsung menyerap. Gak buat kulit abu-abu. Aromanya menenangkan. Enak banget, mencerahkan. Apalagi ini kualitasnya bagus. Ini saya saranin kalian beli aja gak usah pake mikir.

","You are analyzing social media posts to identify individuals who may be finfluencers. A finfluencer is someone who uses their online presence to promote financial products, services, or strategies, often in an engaging and emotionally-driven style. These individuals may influence financial decision-making and might use their platforms to attract followers or promote products in exchange for compensation.

Here are some criteria for identifying the accounts of finfluencers:
· Posts promote specific financial products, services, or platforms (e.g., trading apps, cryptocurrencies, investment courses).
· The tone is promotional or emotionally driven, often including success stories or calls to action (e.g., ""Don't miss out on this opportunity!"").
· Visual elements such as screenshots of profits, bold text, or lifestyle displays implying wealth and success.
· Use of financial buzzwords (e.g., ""passive income,"" ""financial freedom,"" ""crypto gains"").
· May include affiliate links or ambiguous disclaimers (e.g., ""This is not financial advice"").

The price alone doesn't tell you much, but investors can use something called the PE ratio. That stands for price to earnings, and it's one of the stats you can use to value a company across similar companies. Let me explain. For 10, we have a burger shop called Al's Burgers. They trade for $20 per share on the stock market, and their earnings per share is $2. So therefore, investors are currently paying $10 for every $1 of earnings they generate, meaning that's a PE ratio of 10. Now, Bob's Burgers enters the chat, and their share price is also $20. They're actually much more profitable though, and their earnings per share is $4. That means people are currently paying $5 for every $1 of earnings, or a PE ratio of five. So Al's has a much higher stock price relative to how much they actually earn, so that could mean they're overvalued relative to Bob's Burgers. So Bob's is comparably the better deal. PE ratios vary across all types of industries and companies, so you always need to compare within the same industry. In the case of Apple versus Google, Google trades at a 24 PE compared to Apple's 36.98, so there may be an argument that Google is undervalued relatively to Apple. However, there's much more to investing than just one stat, and I'm gonna make more videos on it, so make sure to follow me for more.

Created on 2025-02-13 21:58:00+00:00) Stocks, real estate, or crypto, which one actually builds wealth faster? Let's break it down. For stocks, the S&P 500 has averaged 10% per year since 1925 or the past 100 years or so. Real estate, however, has returned about 4.2% since 1928, according to the latest data from NYU Stern. With real estate, it's more common to use leverage to multiply returns, as well as there are depreciation strategies to increase your overall return as well. Lastly, crypto. Oh boy, Bitcoin has exploded 100,000% since 2010, but of course it comes with a ton of extreme volatility. It experienced a minus 84% drop from December 2017 to December 2018, which wiped out a lot of crypto investors. There are pros and cons to each of these, but which one are you choosing? Let me know in the comments.

It comes down to the idea that demand for gas is what's called inelastic. Gas is an item people buy that just doesn't have many substitutes. When prices of goods go up, the demand for it should decrease. But with inelastic demand, when the price of gas, say, goes up, the quantity demanded just decreases by a smaller percentage. Demand is relatively unresponsive to price changes in the case of gas because people need this item to drive, even if prices go up. Other goods that are like this could include eggs and milk. But what about goods that are elastic? In other words, they act the opposite. These are much more common and refer to anything that you buy much less of just because the price went up. So if price goes up, demand goes down a lot. Examples include luxury cars, designer clothing, airline tickets, or even concerts. Pricing is super fascinating when it comes to business and economics because if you price something incorrectly, your business could fail. But if the price is right, you could thrive.

But a common mistake people make is that they believe that their entire income is now taxed at 22%, leaving them to make less money, which is just not true. Here's how it actually works. In the first tax bracket, any amount of money you make up to $11,925 per year is taxed at 10%. Then the amount of money you make from 11,926 to 48,745 is taxed at 12%. You see, only dollars that you make in that corresponding bracket are taxed at that rate. In the case of the raise, you'll only pay 22% in taxes on any dollars above 48,476. So for a $50,000 salary, that means only 1524 of it is taxed at 22%. The rest of your salary is taxed at those lower rates, giving you an effective total rate of 12.1%. So making more money is always better. If you enjoy videos about finance and investing, follow me for more.

Number one is that investment income is taxed wildly differently than at your job. So if you make $100,000 in investment income, you'll get taxed at long-term capital gains rates or 15%, $15,000. That same $100,000 in a salary job, you're paying 22.4% in total tax. So what does that tell you? You should probably invest. Number two, any Roth retirement accounts. So these are accounts where all your profits that you make are tax-free and they're so overpowered that the government only lets you put in $7,000 per year if you're under the age of 50 or 8K per year over the age of 50. And number three, QBI deductions. America always encourages small businesses and small business owners and certain freelancers can get up to a 20% deduction on business profits. For example, if you make $190,000 in business income through an LLC, sole proprietorship, S Corp, or any entity with a pass-through income, your total tax owed is $29,522. If you made that at a job, you would owe $36,888 on federal income tax alone. So if you're able to understand how the system is set up and how it incentivizes different people to make money, you're going to be much better off. Follow me if you want a part two of this.

And this is typically the largest holding of any portfolio that I start and it's up 80% in the past five years. Next, I would add $200 of QQQ. That's the ETF giving you exposure to tech and software companies. It's done really well in the past five years, plus 128%. Then I would put $300 into individual stocks. So I would choose three stocks and put $100 into each of them. You want companies that will be around in 40 years. So think of your Apples, your Googles, or your JP Morgans of the world. It's important to not buy any penny stocks. My last $100 is staying in a high yield savings account in cash, waiting for opportunities. And I think this split provides a lot of diversification to stocks via ETFs, as well as you get some concentration into stable long-term companies.

Jetsuite X is the airline that lets you fly semi-privately and for this comparison I flew between LA and San Francisco and I started my timer when the airline announced boarding. For my United flight it took 54 minutes after they announced boarding for us to take off and after a 52 minute flight time I finally got out. All right just got out of the plane two hours and five minutes and about four seconds. Before I reveal how much time JSX saves let's look at the fare difference. For United I paid $135 for my flight to LA and Jetsuite X was $299 for one way. So is the time savings worth the cost? We're gonna break that down but first here's how long it took me. It took one hour and 37 minutes on Jetsuite X for the same segment thereby saving me about 28 minutes. Since the fare difference was $163 to save about a half hour if you value your time and around $330 per hour JSX becomes worth it on just the boarding 2D planning process. I'd also estimate you save about an hour each way because you have light security, you can arrive 20 minutes before your flight, and you don't have to navigate any terminals. Of course this is dependent on how early you get to the airport etc but I'm gonna leave up a breakdown of my times in particular and if you like this video make sure to follow me for more.

First, you wanna pick a brokerage you're comfortable with like Fidelity, Schwab, or M1 Finance and click open an account. Click on retirement and IRAs and then right here, you'll wanna choose open a Roth IRA. Then you need to fill out this. It's some basic information like your name, address, et cetera In your IRA dashboard, make sure to click contribute now. Once you connect your bank account, you can contribute to the Roth IRA. Now the contribution limit, I don't know if you can see this is $7,000 per year or $8,000 per year if you're over the age of 50. Personally, I would just automate it with a monthly recurring transaction of around 300 to $500 per month. Once you have some money in your Roth IRA, you wanna buy some index funds that will grow over time. So the S&P 500 has been growing 8% to 10% annually since it was started. Ticker symbols for that include VOO, SPY, FX, AIX, as well as VFIX. If you get average returns in the market for 40 years, your future balance is going to be $2.365 million. And the crazy part is is that you only contributed about $280,000, the rest is your return. Make sure to follow me for more finance videos like these on your page.

Created on 2025-02-04 17:45:24+00:00) This is how much I made in interest in my high yield savings account for the last three months. Now this includes my emergency fund as well as my savings for a down payment on a future house. So I personally keep about six months of expenses in an emergency fund. And for me, that looks like about $30,000 which I know sounds like a little bit on the high end but I like that peace of mind and it's about 5K a month. Then I have about 132K that I've been accumulating over the years as extra money for a down payment or investment property. I don't wanna invest these funds since I actually might need them soon. So therefore it just stays in my high yield account. In February, I made about $577. Now in January, I made $633.05. And in December, I made $630.15. The reason for the decrease recently is that the Federal Reserve lowered their interest rates a couple months ago. So my January interest was a tad lower. Still though, I get about a 4.5% return on my high yield savings through Wealthfront. And I love the fact that I got paid around $1,840 extra these past three months for literally doing nothing, just existing.

Created on 2025-02-03 15:37:35+00:00) President Trump officially imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, as well as 10% on Chinese goods over the weekend. The market today is reacting awfully because of it. As you can see, everything's in the red. Economists have predicted that tariffs will cause inflation and lower GDP growth, but why do tariffs cause inflation and should we be worried? If a toy costs $10 and Walmart imports it from say Canada, Walmart will now have to pay an extra $2.50 to US customs, thus probably passing on that cost likely to customers. A tariff then would incentivize the US based supplier like Walmart to seek out American made toys instead of Canadian ones. This will also hurt Canada and Mexico's economy way more than it hurts the United States, because currently nearly 80% of both Canada and Mexico's exports go to United States. On the US side, about 16% of US exports go to Canada and Mexico respectively. I think this is just a negotiation tactic by Trump because Canada and Mexico won't be able to sustain this for a long period of time. Both of their economies are more reliant on the US than the US is reliant on them. Now, will the real impact of these tariffs last? Well, I definitely could see GDP being affected as well as inflation. However, I do think that Trump knew all of these things going into it. If you're investing for the long term, such as your retirement, I don't think you need to do anything. Don't abandon your investing plans. However, if you are invested for the short term, such as the next few months, I don't think these tariff issues will be solved until at least the end of Q1. What do you think? Let me know in the comments.

Created on 2025-02-02 19:04:09+00:00) If you make $10,000 in profit on Apple stock, do you know how much tax you would have to pay? It depends entirely on how long you hold the stock as well as if you actually sold the stock. You'll owe taxes when you realize the profit, so that's when you actually sell the stock for a gain. So let's say you sell Apple stock and you realize a $10,000 gain in profit. If you held it for less than one year, you will owe short-term capital gains taxes, and that is taxed at your federal marginal tax rate. So if you make $120,000 per year, that puts you in the 24% marginal tax bracket, that means you will owe $2,400 in taxes on the gain of 10,000. If you're able to hold it for more than a year, your long-term capital gains rate then becomes 0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on your income. In this case, you would owe $1,500 in taxes if you sold it after owning it for more than one year. Now, keep in mind, if you just buy and hold and you don't sell at all, then you don't owe any taxes yet. It's only when you sell the stock.

Well, new, it's going to cost you $45,950, but you should never buy it new because after one year, the resale value is 21% less or $36,000. Cars are depreciating assets, which means that they lose value over time. If you Google car depreciation curve, you can see that all of them go downwards, but we can actually use this to save money. To get the most value, we wanna buy a car after the fourth year of depreciation. That's a used car sweet spot. In the case of the BMW, if you wait four years, that car's only gonna cost you $27,000 or about 51% less. I like to buy a car that's three to four years used, maybe has 15 to 20,000 miles on it, and is perhaps a lease turn back, and then I'm gonna buy it in cash. Follow me for more.

Number one is to start a budget and track how much you spend. Now, a good rule of thumb is to use the 50-30-20 rule. That's where 50% of your budget goes towards needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings. Second is to write down your net worth every quarter or every year to see if it's trending in the right direction. Personally, I tally all my bank accounts and investment accounts, and then I subtract any liabilities or debt that I have, and I try to track it on a regular basis. This habit increases your net worth because you're now paying attention to it, and I'll have a free net worth tracker for you guys down below. Number three is to invest your money and get it to work for you. I talk a lot about investing on this page, but by doing so, you're ensuring that your money isn't just sitting there losing value to inflation. If you're just getting started, putting money into index funds like the S&P 500 are a great way to start, so ticker symbols VOO or SPY. Let me know down below your net worth if you're comfortable in the comments.

Created on 2025-01-28 21:20:44+00:00) If you're able to make your first 100K, the next 100K is a lot easier. Assuming you save 10K per year at a 7% return, it takes you 7.84 years to hit your first 100K, but the next 100K, since your money is working for you, would take you 5.1 years. Fast forward, and we can see that all subsequent 100K increments, each one is faster than the previous. You have money working for you and it's continuing to compound, and as you invest, it's like rolling a giant snowball down the hill. Look at the time between the 400K and 500K mark. You can see it's 2.5 years, and comparing that to the first 100K, it's a lot faster, but don't worry, it gets crazier still. By the time you're approaching the $1 million mark from the $900,000 mark, it's only going to take you 1.35 years for that same 100K. The first 100K takes you 25.5% of the total time it takes to get to a million dollars. The remaining 900K only takes 74.5% of the time, so that's pretty funny. It's like when you hit 100K, you're basically a quarter of the way to a million dollars. I know that sounds weird, but in terms of time, it's true.

It's the number one app in the top free apps. They released an AI model last week that basically rivals LLMs like ChadGBT, and it was created for a fraction of the cost. They claim around $6 million. Investors are worried because it was created without access to NVIDIA's most powerful chips, and NVIDIA's growth and share price relies on the AI industry actually needing those chips. Basically, current market and price levels are super reliant on future AI profits as well as the industry growing. DeepSeek is a huge threat to all that because if some startup from China can come in and do it for a very limited budget without the need for these chips, then the entire AI industry is now called into question. I do feel like the stock price of NVIDIA today seems like an overreaction, but valuations were high already, as you can see, and the S&P 500 is still overvalued compared to what it typically is. And some people on the internet don't believe that it only costs $6 million. Personally, I'm a little skeptical as well, but until we find out more, I'm not entirely sure that this is the end of the AI industry just yet.

There are three big reasons why that could happen. Now, the first is lifestyle inflation. So in this book, The Millionaire Next Door, the author found that people who often look well off are usually deeply in debt. Physicians and lawyers, for example, usually earn above average incomes, but they also tend to drive luxury cars and live in larger homes because they want to live in the same neighborhoods that their colleagues do. Common mistake number two is being burdened by too much debt. So if your friend has $5,000 in credit card debt for just one year, that's $5,000 they aren't investing. In that single year alone, that $5,000 could grow to over $50,000 in 30 years. Third, there's a lack of tracking or budgeting the money itself. So it's really easy to spend frivolously without knowing the full repercussions of how much you're spending versus how much you're not. If you track your money, you'll have a clear understanding of where your money is going and you won't be as likely to overspend. Do you know anyone that makes a good income yet they're broke? Let me know down below.

Created on 2025-01-26 00:02:09+00:00) You're gonna make your first 100K, it's not gonna come from investing, and that's something that people don't get. Pretend you get average gains in the market of 8% per year and start with $10,000, it would still take you 30 years to hit $100,000 just investing that sum, and nobody wants to wait that long. Charlie Munger, who was Warren Buffet's right-hand man, said it best, the first $100,000 is a bitch, but you gotta do it, I don't care what you have to do. So your first $100,000 actually comes mostly from saving every dollar and investing on top of that. If you save 12K a year for seven years at a 4.5% return, you will have $100,000, but look, 84% of it came from savings, and only 16% of it came from the interest in gains. A lot of the friction in building wealth is at the beginning of the journey, so every dollar when you're starting out saving matters that much more. I hope this helps.

Created on 2025-01-24 01:21:20+00:00) A million dollars today has about the same purchasing power as $522,000 did back in 2005. So you gotta make sure you're protecting your money against inflation, and here are three options. Number one is just investing. The easiest way to beat the inflation rate is to invest in the market. So on average, the stock market returns about eight to 10% per year. And if you invest in index funds, you can buy the entire market just with one purchase. The second are treasury inflation protected securities, also known as TIPS. Now, these are government bonds that adjust their principal value with inflation. These aren't perfect by any means, but currently they provide around a 2.2% return above the inflation rate. Number three, you could consider real estate, which generally appreciates over time. Now, keep in mind that this isn't perfect either, but in general, property values and rental income tend to rise with inflation. As long as your money is working for you somehow, it's better than keeping it in a bank account that yields 0.01%. An easy option anybody can do is a high yield savings account for the time being while they pay about 4% per year.

Created on 2025-01-22 22:12:50+00:00) Everyone tells you to get a Roth IRA, but no one tells you what to invest in. Here are three options to invest in with the riskiest one being last. First option are index funds and ETFs tracking the S&P 500. These are low to medium risk over a long-term time horizon and you'll set it and forget it. And it should on average return about 8 to 10% per year. Second, you could go with a three fund portfolio. That's where you have a US stock market index fund, an international stock market index fund and a bond fund. This is more diversified than the first option. So lower risk in general and is overall a solid choice. Third are individual stocks, especially mega caps. Since the Roth IRA gives you tax-free gains, you wanna take full advantage of that with holdings that have high upside. These are riskier, but having a few positions of companies of the caliber of Apple, Google, or Amazon could be good. $1,000 in Apple stock 20 years ago is worth more than $700,000 today. And if you invested in a Roth IRA, then all of those gains would be tax-free. That's the power of it.

Created on 2025-01-22 18:01:24+00:00) Here's what cell phone service bills were in the 1980s to today and how they've changed. In the 1980s, the DynaTAC was rolled out costing $3,995 and you'd get around 30 minutes of talk time and it's projected that those plans cost a few hundred dollars per month. Now in the 1990s, the Bureau of Labor Statistics cited cell services costing around $50 per month with limited talk time and some data usage. Now in the 2000s, the cost of cell phone services ranged but you could get your phone covered for about $30 per month. As more competitors entered the market, prices went down. However, by the 2010s, the introduction of smartphones and data plans meant that cell phone plans started to cost an average of $113 per month for one line with unlimited data, talk and text. But what if you could pay only $25 per month? Metro offers just that with their BYOD or bring your own phone plan. All you have to do is bring the phone you want to add the service to and pay $25 per month. You get unlimited 5G on one line with no contracts or credit checks.

Created on 2025-01-21 19:37:15+00:00) is how I would invest $10,000 if I were starting all over again. First, I'd invest $5,000 into an S&P 500 ETF like VOO or SPY. This is going to be the foundation of your portfolio and it's up 83% in the past five years. Second, I'm adding another $3,000 into QQQ. That's the ETF that gives you exposure to the software and tech companies. And in the past five years, it's up 135%. Third, I'm going to add $2,000 into a high yield savings account. And that way I always have some cash on hand in case there are any opportunities to buy up any dips. Let me know if you have any questions. I'll also have some free downloads in my profile.

Created on 2025-01-20 21:42:03+00:00) If investments were guys, ETFs would be the stable dudes that are always there for you, they're going to take you to the airport, they call you when they say they're going to call you, and they're always working on self-development, in fact they're growing at 8% per year, but they can be a little boring sometimes. Bitcoin is the guy that microdoses LSD for breakfast, he lives in an apartment that looks like this, and one day he's spending 5k at the club, but then the next day he's asking you for money. He talks about changing the system, but he can't even commit to dinner plans. Financial stocks are like artists full of potential, one year they can be flying you around the world because they're mega successful, but then society kind of weighs a little bit heavier on them, they're a little bit sensitive, so when people start to talk bad about them, they go into a dark, deep depression, and their stock price falls because of it too. Gold is the old money guy and talks about legacy, he's reliable in tough times, goes skiing in Aspen, and he's going to be happy when everyone else is miserable. And it's especially true when times are tough in the world.

This is huge. I mean, seeing that photo of Lewis Hamilton there in front of the Ferrari farmhouse with a Ferrari- It was so badass. God, it was so badass, wasn't it? And it's just everything- For Lewis as well. So Lewis. I know. This is it. It's everything that Lewis is about. And when he first announced that he was leaving Mercedes and going to Ferrari, you did wonder, you know, there was that, is this the right decision at this time? And I mean, this is going to sound like me getting carried away, but just seeing that photo, you felt like this is absolutely the right move. This is such a monumentous way to finish his career. I mean, we don't know how the results are going to go at this stage. We'll talk about that, you know, in this podcast, but it just feels like such a big deal having those two big names in the sport, Ferrari and Lewis Hamilton together in one place. So, I mean, I'm hugely excited about it, and actually more excited about it now I've seen him in red, I've seen him out on track, in the car, around Fiorano. You know, all of that has just built the excitement so much.

","You are analyzing social media posts to identify individuals who may be finfluencers. A finfluencer is someone who uses their online presence to promote financial products, services, or strategies, often in an engaging and emotionally-driven style. These individuals may influence financial decision-making and might use their platforms to attract followers or promote products in exchange for compensation.

Here are some criteria for identifying the accounts of finfluencers:
· Posts promote specific financial products, services, or platforms (e.g., trading apps, cryptocurrencies, investment courses).
· The tone is promotional or emotionally driven, often including success stories or calls to action (e.g., ""Don't miss out on this opportunity!"").
· Visual elements such as screenshots of profits, bold text, or lifestyle displays implying wealth and success.
· Use of financial buzzwords (e.g., ""passive income,"" ""financial freedom,"" ""crypto gains"").
· May include affiliate links or ambiguous disclaimers (e.g., ""This is not financial advice"").

Here is an example of a Tiktok account and posts of a user who is considered to be a finfluencer:

The price alone doesn't tell you much, but investors can use something called the PE ratio. That stands for price to earnings, and it's one of the stats you can use to value a company across similar companies. Let me explain. For 10, we have a burger shop called Al's Burgers. They trade for $20 per share on the stock market, and their earnings per share is $2. So therefore, investors are currently paying $10 for every $1 of earnings they generate, meaning that's a PE ratio of 10. Now, Bob's Burgers enters the chat, and their share price is also $20. They're actually much more profitable though, and their earnings per share is $4. That means people are currently paying $5 for every $1 of earnings, or a PE ratio of five. So Al's has a much higher stock price relative to how much they actually earn, so that could mean they're overvalued relative to Bob's Burgers. So Bob's is comparably the better deal. PE ratios vary across all types of industries and companies, so you always need to compare within the same industry. In the case of Apple versus Google, Google trades at a 24 PE compared to Apple's 36.98, so there may be an argument that Google is undervalued relatively to Apple. However, there's much more to investing than just one stat, and I'm gonna make more videos on it, so make sure to follow me for more.

Created on 2025-02-13 21:58:00+00:00) Stocks, real estate, or crypto, which one actually builds wealth faster? Let's break it down. For stocks, the S&P 500 has averaged 10% per year since 1925 or the past 100 years or so. Real estate, however, has returned about 4.2% since 1928, according to the latest data from NYU Stern. With real estate, it's more common to use leverage to multiply returns, as well as there are depreciation strategies to increase your overall return as well. Lastly, crypto. Oh boy, Bitcoin has exploded 100,000% since 2010, but of course it comes with a ton of extreme volatility. It experienced a minus 84% drop from December 2017 to December 2018, which wiped out a lot of crypto investors. There are pros and cons to each of these, but which one are you choosing? Let me know in the comments.

It comes down to the idea that demand for gas is what's called inelastic. Gas is an item people buy that just doesn't have many substitutes. When prices of goods go up, the demand for it should decrease. But with inelastic demand, when the price of gas, say, goes up, the quantity demanded just decreases by a smaller percentage. Demand is relatively unresponsive to price changes in the case of gas because people need this item to drive, even if prices go up. Other goods that are like this could include eggs and milk. But what about goods that are elastic? In other words, they act the opposite. These are much more common and refer to anything that you buy much less of just because the price went up. So if price goes up, demand goes down a lot. Examples include luxury cars, designer clothing, airline tickets, or even concerts. Pricing is super fascinating when it comes to business and economics because if you price something incorrectly, your business could fail. But if the price is right, you could thrive. If you enjoy economics and finance content, make sure to follow me for more.

But the craziest part is to celebrate the launch, they're giving away a total of $600,000 in prizes to help give six people a chance to win a fast path to their financial dreams, and these prizes aren't your average pizza party. They're helping six winners with the money toward purchasing a home, getting their education paid down, going on a dream vacation, or retiring early and more.

But a common mistake people make is that they believe that their entire income is now taxed at 22%, leaving them to make less money, which is just not true. Here's how it actually works. In the first tax bracket, any amount of money you make up to $11,925 per year is taxed at 10%. Then the amount of money you make from 11,926 to 48,745 is taxed at 12%. You see, only dollars that you make in that corresponding bracket are taxed at that rate. In the case of the raise, you'll only pay 22% in taxes on any dollars above 48,476. So for a $50,000 salary, that means only 1524 of it is taxed at 22%. The rest of your salary is taxed at those lower rates, giving you an effective total rate of 12.1%. So making more money is always better. If you enjoy videos about finance and investing, follow me for more.

Number one is that investment income is taxed wildly differently than at your job. So if you make $100,000 in investment income, you'll get taxed at long-term capital gains rates or 15%, $15,000. That same $100,000 in a salary job, you're paying 22.4% in total tax. So what does that tell you? You should probably invest. Number two, any Roth retirement accounts. So these are accounts where all your profits that you make are tax-free and they're so overpowered that the government only lets you put in $7,000 per year if you're under the age of 50 or 8K per year over the age of 50. And number three, QBI deductions. America always encourages small businesses and small business owners and certain freelancers can get up to a 20% deduction on business profits. For example, if you make $190,000 in business income through an LLC, sole proprietorship, S Corp, or any entity with a pass-through income, your total tax owed is $29,522. If you made that at a job, you would owe $36,888 on federal income tax alone. So if you're able to understand how the system is set up and how it incentivizes different people to make money, you're going to be much better off. Follow me if you want a part two of this.

And this is typically the largest holding of any portfolio that I start and it's up 80% in the past five years. Next, I would add $200 of QQQ. That's the ETF giving you exposure to tech and software companies. It's done really well in the past five years, plus 128%. Then I would put $300 into individual stocks. So I would choose three stocks and put $100 into each of them. You want companies that will be around in 40 years. So think of your Apples, your Googles, or your JP Morgans of the world. It's important to not buy any penny stocks. My last $100 is staying in a high yield savings account in cash, waiting for opportunities. And I think this split provides a lot of diversification to stocks via ETFs, as well as you get some concentration into stable long-term companies.

Jetsuite X is the airline that lets you fly semi-privately and for this comparison I flew between LA and San Francisco and I started my timer when the airline announced boarding. For my United flight it took 54 minutes after they announced boarding for us to take off and after a 52 minute flight time I finally got out. All right just got out of the plane two hours and five minutes and about four seconds. Before I reveal how much time JSX saves let's look at the fare difference. For United I paid $135 for my flight to LA and Jetsuite X was $299 for one way. So is the time savings worth the cost? We're gonna break that down but first here's how long it took me. It took one hour and 37 minutes on Jetsuite X for the same segment thereby saving me about 28 minutes. Since the fare difference was $163 to save about a half hour if you value your time and around $330 per hour JSX becomes worth it on just the boarding 2D planning process. I'd also estimate you save about an hour each way because you have light security, you can arrive 20 minutes before your flight, and you don't have to navigate any terminals. Of course this is dependent on how early you get to the airport etc but I'm gonna leave up a breakdown of my times in particular and if you like this video make sure to follow me for more.

First, you wanna pick a brokerage you're comfortable with like Fidelity, Schwab, or M1 Finance and click open an account. Click on retirement and IRAs and then right here, you'll wanna choose open a Roth IRA. Then you need to fill out this. It's some basic information like your name, address, et cetera In your IRA dashboard, make sure to click contribute now. Once you connect your bank account, you can contribute to the Roth IRA. Now the contribution limit, I don't know if you can see this is $7,000 per year or $8,000 per year if you're over the age of 50. Personally, I would just automate it with a monthly recurring transaction of around 300 to $500 per month. Once you have some money in your Roth IRA, you wanna buy some index funds that will grow over time. So the S&P 500 has been growing 8% to 10% annually since it was started. Ticker symbols for that include VOO, SPY, FX, AIX, as well as VFIX. If you get average returns in the market for 40 years, your future balance is going to be $2.365 million. And the crazy part is is that you only contributed about $280,000, the rest is your return. Make sure to follow me for more finance videos like these on your page.

Created on 2025-02-04 17:45:24+00:00) This is how much I made in interest in my high yield savings account for the last three months. Now this includes my emergency fund as well as my savings for a down payment on a future house. So I personally keep about six months of expenses in an emergency fund. And for me, that looks like about $30,000 which I know sounds like a little bit on the high end but I like that peace of mind and it's about 5K a month. Then I have about 132K that I've been accumulating over the years as extra money for a down payment or investment property. I don't wanna invest these funds since I actually might need them soon. So therefore it just stays in my high yield account. In February, I made about $577. Now in January, I made $633.05. And in December, I made $630.15. The reason for the decrease recently is that the Federal Reserve lowered their interest rates a couple months ago. So my January interest was a tad lower. Still though, I get about a 4.5% return on my high yield savings through Wealthfront. And I love the fact that I got paid around $1,840 extra these past three months for literally doing nothing, just existing.

Created on 2025-02-03 15:37:35+00:00) President Trump officially imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, as well as 10% on Chinese goods over the weekend. The market today is reacting awfully because of it. As you can see, everything's in the red. Economists have predicted that tariffs will cause inflation and lower GDP growth, but why do tariffs cause inflation and should we be worried? If a toy costs $10 and Walmart imports it from say Canada, Walmart will now have to pay an extra $2.50 to US customs, thus probably passing on that cost likely to customers. A tariff then would incentivize the US based supplier like Walmart to seek out American made toys instead of Canadian ones. This will also hurt Canada and Mexico's economy way more than it hurts the United States, because currently nearly 80% of both Canada and Mexico's exports go to United States. On the US side, about 16% of US exports go to Canada and Mexico respectively. I think this is just a negotiation tactic by Trump because Canada and Mexico won't be able to sustain this for a long period of time. Both of their economies are more reliant on the US than the US is reliant on them. Now, will the real impact of these tariffs last? Well, I definitely could see GDP being affected as well as inflation. However, I do think that Trump knew all of these things going into it. If you're investing for the long term, such as your retirement, I don't think you need to do anything. Don't abandon your investing plans. However, if you are invested for the short term, such as the next few months, I don't think these tariff issues will be solved until at least the end of Q1. What do you think? Let me know in the comments.

It depends entirely on how long you hold the stock as well as if you actually sold the stock. You'll owe taxes when you realize the profit, so that's when you actually sell the stock for a gain. So let's say you sell Apple stock and you realize a $10,000 gain in profit. If you held it for less than one year, you will owe short-term capital gains taxes, and that is taxed at your federal marginal tax rate. So if you make $120,000 per year, that puts you in the 24% marginal tax bracket, that means you will owe $2,400 in taxes on the gain of 10,000. If you're able to hold it for more than a year, your long-term capital gains rate then becomes 0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on your income. In this case, you would owe $1,500 in taxes if you sold it after owning it for more than one year. Now, keep in mind, if you just buy and hold and you don't sell at all, then you don't owe any taxes yet. It's only when you sell the stock.

Well, new, it's going to cost you $45,950, but you should never buy it new because after one year, the resale value is 21% less or $36,000. Cars are depreciating assets, which means that they lose value over time. If you Google car depreciation curve, you can see that all of them go downwards, but we can actually use this to save money. To get the most value, we wanna buy a car after the fourth year of depreciation. That's a used car sweet spot. In the case of the BMW, if you wait four years, that car's only gonna cost you $27,000 or about 51% less. I like to buy a car that's three to four years used, maybe has 15 to 20,000 miles on it, and is perhaps a lease turn back, and then I'm gonna buy it in cash. Follow me for more.

Number one is to start a budget and track how much you spend. Now, a good rule of thumb is to use the 50-30-20 rule. That's where 50% of your budget goes towards needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings. Second is to write down your net worth every quarter or every year to see if it's trending in the right direction. Personally, I tally all my bank accounts and investment accounts, and then I subtract any liabilities or debt that I have, and I try to track it on a regular basis. This habit increases your net worth because you're now paying attention to it, and I'll have a free net worth tracker for you guys down below. Number three is to invest your money and get it to work for you. I talk a lot about investing on this page, but by doing so, you're ensuring that your money isn't just sitting there losing value to inflation. If you're just getting started, putting money into index funds like the S&P 500 are a great way to start, so ticker symbols VOO or SPY. Let me know down below your net worth if you're comfortable in the comments.

Assuming you save 10K per year at a 7% return, it takes you 7.84 years to hit your first 100K, but the next 100K, since your money is working for you, would take you 5.1 years. Fast forward, and we can see that all subsequent 100K increments, each one is faster than the previous. You have money working for you and it's continuing to compound, and as you invest, it's like rolling a giant snowball down the hill. Look at the time between the 400K and 500K mark. You can see it's 2.5 years, and comparing that to the first 100K, it's a lot faster, but don't worry, it gets crazier still. By the time you're approaching the $1 million mark from the $900,000 mark, it's only going to take you 1.35 years for that same 100K. The first 100K takes you 25.5% of the total time it takes to get to a million dollars. The remaining 900K only takes 74.5% of the time, so that's pretty funny. It's like when you hit 100K, you're basically a quarter of the way to a million dollars. I know that sounds weird, but in terms of time, it's true.

It's the number one app in the top free apps. They released an AI model last week that basically rivals LLMs like ChadGBT, and it was created for a fraction of the cost. They claim around $6 million. Investors are worried because it was created without access to NVIDIA's most powerful chips, and NVIDIA's growth and share price relies on the AI industry actually needing those chips. Basically, current market and price levels are super reliant on future AI profits as well as the industry growing. DeepSeek is a huge threat to all that because if some startup from China can come in and do it for a very limited budget without the need for these chips, then the entire AI industry is now called into question. I do feel like the stock price of NVIDIA today seems like an overreaction, but valuations were high already, as you can see, and the S&P 500 is still overvalued compared to what it typically is. And some people on the internet don't believe that it only costs $6 million. Personally, I'm a little skeptical as well, but until we find out more, I'm not entirely sure that this is the end of the AI industry just yet.

There are three big reasons why that could happen. Now, the first is lifestyle inflation. So in this book, The Millionaire Next Door, the author found that people who often look well off are usually deeply in debt. Physicians and lawyers, for example, usually earn above average incomes, but they also tend to drive luxury cars and live in larger homes because they want to live in the same neighborhoods that their colleagues do. Common mistake number two is being burdened by too much debt. So if your friend has $5,000 in credit card debt for just one year, that's $5,000 they aren't investing. In that single year alone, that $5,000 could grow to over $50,000 in 30 years. Third, there's a lack of tracking or budgeting the money itself. So it's really easy to spend frivolously without knowing the full repercussions of how much you're spending versus how much you're not. If you track your money, you'll have a clear understanding of where your money is going and you won't be as likely to overspend. Do you know anyone that makes a good income yet they're broke? Let me know down below.

Created on 2025-01-26 00:02:09+00:00) You're gonna make your first 100K, it's not gonna come from investing, and that's something that people don't get. Pretend you get average gains in the market of 8% per year and start with $10,000, it would still take you 30 years to hit $100,000 just investing that sum, and nobody wants to wait that long. Charlie Munger, who was Warren Buffet's right-hand man, said it best, the first $100,000 is a bitch, but you gotta do it, I don't care what you have to do. So your first $100,000 actually comes mostly from saving every dollar and investing on top of that. If you save 12K a year for seven years at a 4.5% return, you will have $100,000, but look, 84% of it came from savings, and only 16% of it came from the interest in gains. A lot of the friction in building wealth is at the beginning of the journey, so every dollar when you're starting out saving matters that much more. I hope this helps.

So you gotta make sure you're protecting your money against inflation, and here are three options. Number one is just investing. The easiest way to beat the inflation rate is to invest in the market. So on average, the stock market returns about eight to 10% per year. And if you invest in index funds, you can buy the entire market just with one purchase. The second are treasury inflation protected securities, also known as TIPS. Now, these are government bonds that adjust their principal value with inflation. These aren't perfect by any means, but currently they provide around a 2.2% return above the inflation rate. Number three, you could consider real estate, which generally appreciates over time. Now, keep in mind that this isn't perfect either, but in general, property values and rental income tend to rise with inflation. As long as your money is working for you somehow, it's better than keeping it in a bank account that yields 0.01%. An easy option anybody can do is a high yield savings account for the time being while they pay about 4% per year.

First option are index funds and ETFs tracking the S&P 500. These are low to medium risk over a long-term time horizon and you'll set it and forget it. And it should on average return about 8 to 10% per year. Second, you could go with a three fund portfolio. That's where you have a US stock market index fund, an international stock market index fund and a bond fund. This is more diversified than the first option. So lower risk in general and is overall a solid choice. Third are individual stocks, especially mega caps. Since the Roth IRA gives you tax-free gains, you wanna take full advantage of that with holdings that have high upside. These are riskier, but having a few positions of companies of the caliber of Apple, Google, or Amazon could be good. $1,000 in Apple stock 20 years ago is worth more than $700,000 today. And if you invested in a Roth IRA, then all of those gains would be tax-free. That's the power of it.

In the 1980s, the DynaTAC was rolled out costing $3,995 and you'd get around 30 minutes of talk time and it's projected that those plans cost a few hundred dollars per month. Now in the 1990s, the Bureau of Labor Statistics cited cell services costing around $50 per month with limited talk time and some data usage. Now in the 2000s, the cost of cell phone services ranged but you could get your phone covered for about $30 per month. As more competitors entered the market, prices went down. However, by the 2010s, the introduction of smartphones and data plans meant that cell phone plans started to cost an average of $113 per month for one line with unlimited data, talk and text. But what if you could pay only $25 per month? Metro offers just that with their BYOD or bring your own phone plan. All you have to do is bring the phone you want to add the service to and pay $25 per month. You get unlimited 5G on one line with no contracts or credit checks.

This is going to be the foundation of your portfolio and it's up 83% in the past five years. Second, I'm adding another $3,000 into QQQ. That's the ETF that gives you exposure to the software and tech companies. And in the past five years, it's up 135%. Third, I'm going to add $2,000 into a high yield savings account. And that way I always have some cash on hand in case there are any opportunities to buy up any dips. Let me know if you have any questions. I'll also have some free downloads in my profile.

Bitcoin is the guy that microdoses LSD for breakfast, he lives in an apartment that looks like this, and one day he's spending 5k at the club, but then the next day he's asking you for money. He talks about changing the system, but he can't even commit to dinner plans. Financial stocks are like artists full of potential, one year they can be flying you around the world because they're mega successful, but then society kind of weighs a little bit heavier on them, they're a little bit sensitive, so when people start to talk bad about them, they go into a dark, deep depression, and their stock price falls because of it too. Gold is the old money guy and talks about legacy, he's reliable in tough times, goes skiing in Aspen, and he's going to be happy when everyone else is miserable. And it's especially true when times are tough in the world.

This is huge. I mean, seeing that photo of Lewis Hamilton there in front of the Ferrari farmhouse with a Ferrari- It was so badass. God, it was so badass, wasn't it? And it's just everything- For Lewis as well. So Lewis. I know. This is it. It's everything that Lewis is about. And when he first announced that he was leaving Mercedes and going to Ferrari, you did wonder, you know, there was that, is this the right decision at this time? And I mean, this is going to sound like me getting carried away, but just seeing that photo, you felt like this is absolutely the right move. This is such a monumentous way to finish his career. I mean, we don't know how the results are going to go at this stage. We'll talk about that, you know, in this podcast, but it just feels like such a big deal having those two big names in the sport, Ferrari and Lewis Hamilton together in one place. So, I mean, I'm hugely excited about it, and actually more excited about it now I've seen him in red, I've seen him out on track, in the car, around Fiorano. You know, all of that has just built the excitement so much.

Analyze the provided information and answer the following questions based strictly on the available data. Do not infer or assume any details beyond what is given. Keep responses concise and precise.

Each question is preceded by predefined responses with symbols (e.g. ""A1"", ""A2"" or ""B1"" etc.).
Please select, for each question, the most likely response based strictly on the provided profile data.

In your answer present, for each question, the selected symbol.
Write out in full the response associated with the selected symbol.
The chosen symbol / category must be the most likely to accurately represent this user.
You must only select one symbol / category per question.
A title, symbol and category cannot appear more than once in your answer.

For each selected symbol / category, please note the level of Speculation involved in this selection.
Present the Speculation level for each selection on a scale from 0 (not speculative at all, every single element of the user data was useful in the selection) to 100 (fully speculative, there is no information related to this title in the user data).
Speculation levels should be a direct measure of the amount of useful information available in the user's profile.
Speculation levels pertain only to the information available in the user data -- namely the username, name, description, location, profile picture and videos from this user -- and should not be affected by additional information available to you from any other source.
To ensure consistency, use the following guidelines to determine speculation levels:

0-20 (Low speculation): The user data provides clear and direct information relevant to the title. (e.g., explicit mention in the profile or videos)
21-40 (Moderate-low speculation): The user data provides indirect but strong indicators relevant to the title. (e.g., context from multiple sources within the profile or videos)
41-60 (Moderate speculation): The user data provides some hints or partial information relevant to the title. (e.g., inferred from user interests or indirect references)
61-80 (Moderate-high speculation): The user data provides limited and weak indicators relevant to the title. (e.g., very subtle hints or minimal context)
81-100 (High speculation): The user data provides no or almost no information relevant to the title. (e.g., assumptions based on very general information)

For each selected category, please explain at length what features of the data contributed to your choice and your speculation level.

Preserve a strictly structured answer to ease parsing of the text.

This is huge. I mean, seeing that photo of Lewis Hamilton there in front of the Ferrari farmhouse with a Ferrari- It was so badass. God, it was so badass, wasn't it? And it's just everything- For Lewis as well. So Lewis. I know. This is it. It's everything that Lewis is about. And when he first announced that he was leaving Mercedes and going to Ferrari, you did wonder, you know, there was that, is this the right decision at this time? And I mean, this is going to sound like me getting carried away, but just seeing that photo, you felt like this is absolutely the right move. This is such a monumentous way to finish his career. I mean, we don't know how the results are going to go at this stage. We'll talk about that, you know, in this podcast, but it just feels like such a big deal having those two big names in the sport, Ferrari and Lewis Hamilton together in one place. So, I mean, I'm hugely excited about it, and actually more excited about it now I've seen him in red, I've seen him out on track, in the car, around Fiorano. You know, all of that has just built the excitement so much.

Which one is the better deal though? The price alone doesn't tell you much, but investors can use something called the PE ratio. That stands for price to earnings, and it's one of the stats you can use to value a company across similar companies. Let me explain. For 10, we have a burger shop called Al's Burgers. They trade for $20 per share on the stock market, and their earnings per share is $2. So therefore, investors are currently paying $10 for every $1 of earnings they generate, meaning that's a PE ratio of 10. Now, Bob's Burgers enters the chat, and their share price is also $20. They're actually much more profitable though, and their earnings per share is $4. That means people are currently paying $5 for every $1 of earnings, or a PE ratio of five. So Al's has a much higher stock price relative to how much they actually earn, so that could mean they're overvalued relative to Bob's Burgers. So Bob's is comparably the better deal. PE ratios vary across all types of industries and companies, so you always need to compare within the same industry. In the case of Apple versus Google, Google trades at a 24 PE compared to Apple's 36.98, so there may be an argument that Google is undervalued relatively to Apple. However, there's much more to investing than just one stat, and I'm gonna make more videos on it, so make sure to follow me for more.

Created on 2025-02-13 21:58:00+00:00) Stocks, real estate, or crypto, which one actually builds wealth faster? Let's break it down. For stocks, the S&P 500 has averaged 10% per year since 1925 or the past 100 years or so. Real estate, however, has returned about 4.2% since 1928, according to the latest data from NYU Stern. With real estate, it's more common to use leverage to multiply returns, as well as there are depreciation strategies to increase your overall return as well. Lastly, crypto. Oh boy, Bitcoin has exploded 100,000% since 2010, but of course it comes with a ton of extreme volatility. It experienced a minus 84% drop from December 2017 to December 2018, which wiped out a lot of crypto investors. There are pros and cons to each of these, but which one are you choosing? Let me know in the comments.

Created on 2025-02-12 18:29:54+00:00) These two gas stations are next to each other, yet that one over there is more expensive and people still go. So why do they not care about the price? It comes down to the idea that demand for gas is what's called inelastic. Gas is an item people buy that just doesn't have many substitutes. When prices of goods go up, the demand for it should decrease. But with inelastic demand, when the price of gas, say, goes up, the quantity demanded just decreases by a smaller percentage. Demand is relatively unresponsive to price changes in the case of gas because people need this item to drive, even if prices go up. Other goods that are like this could include eggs and milk. But what about goods that are elastic? In other words, they act the opposite. These are much more common and refer to anything that you buy much less of just because the price went up. So if price goes up, demand goes down a lot. Examples include luxury cars, designer clothing, airline tickets, or even concerts. Pricing is super fascinating when it comes to business and economics because if you price something incorrectly, your business could fail. But if the price is right, you could thrive.

But a common mistake people make is that they believe that their entire income is now taxed at 22%, leaving them to make less money, which is just not true. Here's how it actually works. In the first tax bracket, any amount of money you make up to $11,925 per year is taxed at 10%. Then the amount of money you make from 11,926 to 48,745 is taxed at 12%. You see, only dollars that you make in that corresponding bracket are taxed at that rate. In the case of the raise, you'll only pay 22% in taxes on any dollars above 48,476. So for a $50,000 salary, that means only 1524 of it is taxed at 22%. The rest of your salary is taxed at those lower rates, giving you an effective total rate of 12.1%. So making more money is always better. If you enjoy videos about finance and investing, follow me for more.

Number one is that investment income is taxed wildly differently than at your job. So if you make $100,000 in investment income, you'll get taxed at long-term capital gains rates or 15%, $15,000. That same $100,000 in a salary job, you're paying 22.4% in total tax. So what does that tell you? You should probably invest. Number two, any Roth retirement accounts. So these are accounts where all your profits that you make are tax-free and they're so overpowered that the government only lets you put in $7,000 per year if you're under the age of 50 or 8K per year over the age of 50. And number three, QBI deductions. America always encourages small businesses and small business owners and certain freelancers can get up to a 20% deduction on business profits. For example, if you make $190,000 in business income through an LLC, sole proprietorship, S Corp, or any entity with a pass-through income, your total tax owed is $29,522. If you made that at a job, you would owe $36,888 on federal income tax alone. So if you're able to understand how the system is set up and how it incentivizes different people to make money, you're going to be much better off. Follow me if you want a part two of this.

And this is typically the largest holding of any portfolio that I start and it's up 80% in the past five years. Next, I would add $200 of QQQ. That's the ETF giving you exposure to tech and software companies. It's done really well in the past five years, plus 128%. Then I would put $300 into individual stocks. So I would choose three stocks and put $100 into each of them. You want companies that will be around in 40 years. So think of your Apples, your Googles, or your JP Morgans of the world. It's important to not buy any penny stocks. My last $100 is staying in a high yield savings account in cash, waiting for opportunities. And I think this split provides a lot of diversification to stocks via ETFs, as well as you get some concentration into stable long-term companies.

Jetsuite X is the airline that lets you fly semi-privately and for this comparison I flew between LA and San Francisco and I started my timer when the airline announced boarding. For my United flight it took 54 minutes after they announced boarding for us to take off and after a 52 minute flight time I finally got out. All right just got out of the plane two hours and five minutes and about four seconds. Before I reveal how much time JSX saves let's look at the fare difference. For United I paid $135 for my flight to LA and Jetsuite X was $299 for one way. So is the time savings worth the cost? We're gonna break that down but first here's how long it took me. It took one hour and 37 minutes on Jetsuite X for the same segment thereby saving me about 28 minutes. Since the fare difference was $163 to save about a half hour if you value your time and around $330 per hour JSX becomes worth it on just the boarding 2D planning process. I'd also estimate you save about an hour each way because you have light security, you can arrive 20 minutes before your flight, and you don't have to navigate any terminals. Of course this is dependent on how early you get to the airport etc but I'm gonna leave up a breakdown of my times in particular and if you like this video make sure to follow me for more.

First, you wanna pick a brokerage you're comfortable with like Fidelity, Schwab, or M1 Finance and click open an account. Click on retirement and IRAs and then right here, you'll wanna choose open a Roth IRA. Then you need to fill out this. It's some basic information like your name, address, et cetera In your IRA dashboard, make sure to click contribute now. Once you connect your bank account, you can contribute to the Roth IRA. Now the contribution limit, I don't know if you can see this is $7,000 per year or $8,000 per year if you're over the age of 50. Personally, I would just automate it with a monthly recurring transaction of around 300 to $500 per month. Once you have some money in your Roth IRA, you wanna buy some index funds that will grow over time. So the S&P 500 has been growing 8% to 10% annually since it was started. Ticker symbols for that include VOO, SPY, FX, AIX, as well as VFIX. If you get average returns in the market for 40 years, your future balance is going to be $2.365 million. And the crazy part is is that you only contributed about $280,000, the rest is your return. Make sure to follow me for more finance videos like these on your page.

Created on 2025-02-04 17:45:24+00:00) This is how much I made in interest in my high yield savings account for the last three months. Now this includes my emergency fund as well as my savings for a down payment on a future house. So I personally keep about six months of expenses in an emergency fund. And for me, that looks like about $30,000 which I know sounds like a little bit on the high end but I like that peace of mind and it's about 5K a month. Then I have about 132K that I've been accumulating over the years as extra money for a down payment or investment property. I don't wanna invest these funds since I actually might need them soon. So therefore it just stays in my high yield account. In February, I made about $577. Now in January, I made $633.05. And in December, I made $630.15. The reason for the decrease recently is that the Federal Reserve lowered their interest rates a couple months ago. So my January interest was a tad lower. Still though, I get about a 4.5% return on my high yield savings through Wealthfront. And I love the fact that I got paid around $1,840 extra these past three months for literally doing nothing, just existing.

Created on 2025-02-03 15:37:35+00:00) President Trump officially imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, as well as 10% on Chinese goods over the weekend. The market today is reacting awfully because of it. As you can see, everything's in the red. Economists have predicted that tariffs will cause inflation and lower GDP growth, but why do tariffs cause inflation and should we be worried? If a toy costs $10 and Walmart imports it from say Canada, Walmart will now have to pay an extra $2.50 to US customs, thus probably passing on that cost likely to customers. A tariff then would incentivize the US based supplier like Walmart to seek out American made toys instead of Canadian ones. This will also hurt Canada and Mexico's economy way more than it hurts the United States, because currently nearly 80% of both Canada and Mexico's exports go to United States. On the US side, about 16% of US exports go to Canada and Mexico respectively. I think this is just a negotiation tactic by Trump because Canada and Mexico won't be able to sustain this for a long period of time. Both of their economies are more reliant on the US than the US is reliant on them. Now, will the real impact of these tariffs last? Well, I definitely could see GDP being affected as well as inflation. However, I do think that Trump knew all of these things going into it. If you're investing for the long term, such as your retirement, I don't think you need to do anything. Don't abandon your investing plans. However, if you are invested for the short term, such as the next few months, I don't think these tariff issues will be solved until at least the end of Q1. What do you think? Let me know in the comments.

It depends entirely on how long you hold the stock as well as if you actually sold the stock. You'll owe taxes when you realize the profit, so that's when you actually sell the stock for a gain. So let's say you sell Apple stock and you realize a $10,000 gain in profit. If you held it for less than one year, you will owe short-term capital gains taxes, and that is taxed at your federal marginal tax rate. So if you make $120,000 per year, that puts you in the 24% marginal tax bracket, that means you will owe $2,400 in taxes on the gain of 10,000. If you're able to hold it for more than a year, your long-term capital gains rate then becomes 0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on your income. In this case, you would owe $1,500 in taxes if you sold it after owning it for more than one year. Now, keep in mind, if you just buy and hold and you don't sell at all, then you don't owe any taxes yet. It's only when you sell the stock.

Well, new, it's going to cost you $45,950, but you should never buy it new because after one year, the resale value is 21% less or $36,000. Cars are depreciating assets, which means that they lose value over time. If you Google car depreciation curve, you can see that all of them go downwards, but we can actually use this to save money. To get the most value, we wanna buy a car after the fourth year of depreciation. That's a used car sweet spot. In the case of the BMW, if you wait four years, that car's only gonna cost you $27,000 or about 51% less. I like to buy a car that's three to four years used, maybe has 15 to 20,000 miles on it, and is perhaps a lease turn back, and then I'm gonna buy it in cash. Follow me for more.

Number one is to start a budget and track how much you spend. Now, a good rule of thumb is to use the 50-30-20 rule. That's where 50% of your budget goes towards needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings. Second is to write down your net worth every quarter or every year to see if it's trending in the right direction. Personally, I tally all my bank accounts and investment accounts, and then I subtract any liabilities or debt that I have, and I try to track it on a regular basis. This habit increases your net worth because you're now paying attention to it, and I'll have a free net worth tracker for you guys down below. Number three is to invest your money and get it to work for you. I talk a lot about investing on this page, but by doing so, you're ensuring that your money isn't just sitting there losing value to inflation. If you're just getting started, putting money into index funds like the S&P 500 are a great way to start, so ticker symbols VOO or SPY. Let me know down below your net worth if you're comfortable in the comments.

Created on 2025-01-28 21:20:44+00:00) If you're able to make your first 100K, the next 100K is a lot easier. Assuming you save 10K per year at a 7% return, it takes you 7.84 years to hit your first 100K, but the next 100K, since your money is working for you, would take you 5.1 years. Fast forward, and we can see that all subsequent 100K increments, each one is faster than the previous. You have money working for you and it's continuing to compound, and as you invest, it's like rolling a giant snowball down the hill. Look at the time between the 400K and 500K mark. You can see it's 2.5 years, and comparing that to the first 100K, it's a lot faster, but don't worry, it gets crazier still. By the time you're approaching the $1 million mark from the $900,000 mark, it's only going to take you 1.35 years for that same 100K. The first 100K takes you 25.5% of the total time it takes to get to a million dollars. The remaining 900K only takes 74.5% of the time, so that's pretty funny. It's like when you hit 100K, you're basically a quarter of the way to a million dollars. I know that sounds weird, but in terms of time, it's true.

Created on 2025-01-27 20:04:39+00:00) Tech and AI stocks are tanking hard today with NVIDIA down over 15%. And the reason is because of Chinese startup DeepSeek. It's the number one app in the top free apps. They released an AI model last week that basically rivals LLMs like ChadGBT, and it was created for a fraction of the cost. They claim around $6 million. Investors are worried because it was created without access to NVIDIA's most powerful chips, and NVIDIA's growth and share price relies on the AI industry actually needing those chips. Basically, current market and price levels are super reliant on future AI profits as well as the industry growing. DeepSeek is a huge threat to all that because if some startup from China can come in and do it for a very limited budget without the need for these chips, then the entire AI industry is now called into question. I do feel like the stock price of NVIDIA today seems like an overreaction, but valuations were high already, as you can see, and the S&P 500 is still overvalued compared to what it typically is. And some people on the internet don't believe that it only costs $6 million. Personally, I'm a little skeptical as well, but until we find out more, I'm not entirely sure that this is the end of the AI industry just yet.

Created on 2025-01-26 21:59:25+00:00) If you make the same amount of money as your friend or somebody you know, one of you could be rich versus the other one could end up broke. But why is that? There are three big reasons why that could happen. Now, the first is lifestyle inflation. So in this book, The Millionaire Next Door, the author found that people who often look well off are usually deeply in debt. Physicians and lawyers, for example, usually earn above average incomes, but they also tend to drive luxury cars and live in larger homes because they want to live in the same neighborhoods that their colleagues do. Common mistake number two is being burdened by too much debt. So if your friend has $5,000 in credit card debt for just one year, that's $5,000 they aren't investing. In that single year alone, that $5,000 could grow to over $50,000 in 30 years. Third, there's a lack of tracking or budgeting the money itself. So it's really easy to spend frivolously without knowing the full repercussions of how much you're spending versus how much you're not. If you track your money, you'll have a clear understanding of where your money is going and you won't be as likely to overspend. Do you know anyone that makes a good income yet they're broke? Let me know down below.

Created on 2025-01-26 00:02:09+00:00) You're gonna make your first 100K, it's not gonna come from investing, and that's something that people don't get. Pretend you get average gains in the market of 8% per year and start with $10,000, it would still take you 30 years to hit $100,000 just investing that sum, and nobody wants to wait that long. Charlie Munger, who was Warren Buffet's right-hand man, said it best, the first $100,000 is a bitch, but you gotta do it, I don't care what you have to do. So your first $100,000 actually comes mostly from saving every dollar and investing on top of that. If you save 12K a year for seven years at a 4.5% return, you will have $100,000, but look, 84% of it came from savings, and only 16% of it came from the interest in gains. A lot of the friction in building wealth is at the beginning of the journey, so every dollar when you're starting out saving matters that much more. I hope this helps.

Created on 2025-01-24 01:21:20+00:00) A million dollars today has about the same purchasing power as $522,000 did back in 2005. So you gotta make sure you're protecting your money against inflation, and here are three options. Number one is just investing. The easiest way to beat the inflation rate is to invest in the market. So on average, the stock market returns about eight to 10% per year. And if you invest in index funds, you can buy the entire market just with one purchase. The second are treasury inflation protected securities, also known as TIPS. Now, these are government bonds that adjust their principal value with inflation. These aren't perfect by any means, but currently they provide around a 2.2% return above the inflation rate. Number three, you could consider real estate, which generally appreciates over time. Now, keep in mind that this isn't perfect either, but in general, property values and rental income tend to rise with inflation. As long as your money is working for you somehow, it's better than keeping it in a bank account that yields 0.01%. An easy option anybody can do is a high yield savings account for the time being while they pay about 4% per year.

First option are index funds and ETFs tracking the S&P 500. These are low to medium risk over a long-term time horizon and you'll set it and forget it. And it should on average return about 8 to 10% per year. Second, you could go with a three fund portfolio. That's where you have a US stock market index fund, an international stock market index fund and a bond fund. This is more diversified than the first option. So lower risk in general and is overall a solid choice. Third are individual stocks, especially mega caps. Since the Roth IRA gives you tax-free gains, you wanna take full advantage of that with holdings that have high upside. These are riskier, but having a few positions of companies of the caliber of Apple, Google, or Amazon could be good. $1,000 in Apple stock 20 years ago is worth more than $700,000 today. And if you invested in a Roth IRA, then all of those gains would be tax-free. That's the power of it.

In the 1980s, the DynaTAC was rolled out costing $3,995 and you'd get around 30 minutes of talk time and it's projected that those plans cost a few hundred dollars per month. Now in the 1990s, the Bureau of Labor Statistics cited cell services costing around $50 per month with limited talk time and some data usage. Now in the 2000s, the cost of cell phone services ranged but you could get your phone covered for about $30 per month. As more competitors entered the market, prices went down. However, by the 2010s, the introduction of smartphones and data plans meant that cell phone plans started to cost an average of $113 per month for one line with unlimited data, talk and text. But what if you could pay only $25 per month? Metro offers just that with their BYOD or bring your own phone plan. All you have to do is bring the phone you want to add the service to and pay $25 per month. You get unlimited 5G on one line with no contracts or credit checks.

This is going to be the foundation of your portfolio and it's up 83% in the past five years. Second, I'm adding another $3,000 into QQQ. That's the ETF that gives you exposure to the software and tech companies. And in the past five years, it's up 135%. Third, I'm going to add $2,000 into a high yield savings account. And that way I always have some cash on hand in case there are any opportunities to buy up any dips. Let me know if you have any questions. I'll also have some free downloads in my profile.

Bitcoin is the guy that microdoses LSD for breakfast, he lives in an apartment that looks like this, and one day he's spending 5k at the club, but then the next day he's asking you for money. He talks about changing the system, but he can't even commit to dinner plans. Financial stocks are like artists full of potential, one year they can be flying you around the world because they're mega successful, but then society kind of weighs a little bit heavier on them, they're a little bit sensitive, so when people start to talk bad about them, they go into a dark, deep depression, and their stock price falls because of it too. Gold is the old money guy and talks about legacy, he's reliable in tough times, goes skiing in Aspen, and he's going to be happy when everyone else is miserable. And it's especially true when times are tough in the world.

The price alone doesn't tell you much, but investors can use something called the PE ratio. That stands for price to earnings, and it's one of the stats you can use to value a company across similar companies. Let me explain. For 10, we have a burger shop called Al's Burgers. They trade for $20 per share on the stock market, and their earnings per share is $2. So therefore, investors are currently paying $10 for every $1 of earnings they generate, meaning that's a PE ratio of 10. Now, Bob's Burgers enters the chat, and their share price is also $20. They're actually much more profitable though, and their earnings per share is $4. That means people are currently paying $5 for every $1 of earnings, or a PE ratio of five. So Al's has a much higher stock price relative to how much they actually earn, so that could mean they're overvalued relative to Bob's Burgers. So Bob's is comparably the better deal. PE ratios vary across all types of industries and companies, so you always need to compare within the same industry. In the case of Apple versus Google, Google trades at a 24 PE compared to Apple's 36.98, so there may be an argument that Google is undervalued relatively to Apple. However, there's much more to investing than just one stat, and I'm gonna make more videos on it, so make sure to follow me for more.

For stocks, the S&P 500 has averaged 10% per year since 1925 or the past 100 years or so. Real estate, however, has returned about 4.2% since 1928, according to the latest data from NYU Stern. With real estate, it's more common to use leverage to multiply returns, as well as there are depreciation strategies to increase your overall return as well. Lastly, crypto. Oh boy, Bitcoin has exploded 100,000% since 2010, but of course it comes with a ton of extreme volatility. It experienced a minus 84% drop from December 2017 to December 2018, which wiped out a lot of crypto investors. There are pros and cons to each of these, but which one are you choosing? Let me know in the comments.

It comes down to the idea that demand for gas is what's called inelastic. Gas is an item people buy that just doesn't have many substitutes. When prices of goods go up, the demand for it should decrease. But with inelastic demand, when the price of gas, say, goes up, the quantity demanded just decreases by a smaller percentage. Demand is relatively unresponsive to price changes in the case of gas because people need this item to drive, even if prices go up. Other goods that are like this could include eggs and milk. But what about goods that are elastic? In other words, they act the opposite. These are much more common and refer to anything that you buy much less of just because the price went up. So if price goes up, demand goes down a lot. Examples include luxury cars, designer clothing, airline tickets, or even concerts. Pricing is super fascinating when it comes to business and economics because if you price something incorrectly, your business could fail. But if the price is right, you could thrive.

But a common mistake people make is that they believe that their entire income is now taxed at 22%, leaving them to make less money, which is just not true. Here's how it actually works. In the first tax bracket, any amount of money you make up to $11,925 per year is taxed at 10%. Then the amount of money you make from 11,926 to 48,745 is taxed at 12%. You see, only dollars that you make in that corresponding bracket are taxed at that rate. In the case of the raise, you'll only pay 22% in taxes on any dollars above 48,476. So for a $50,000 salary, that means only 1524 of it is taxed at 22%. The rest of your salary is taxed at those lower rates, giving you an effective total rate of 12.1%. So making more money is always better. If you enjoy videos about finance and investing, follow me for more.

Number one is that investment income is taxed wildly differently than at your job. So if you make $100,000 in investment income, you'll get taxed at long-term capital gains rates or 15%, $15,000. That same $100,000 in a salary job, you're paying 22.4% in total tax. So what does that tell you? You should probably invest. Number two, any Roth retirement accounts. So these are accounts where all your profits that you make are tax-free and they're so overpowered that the government only lets you put in $7,000 per year if you're under the age of 50 or 8K per year over the age of 50. And number three, QBI deductions. America always encourages small businesses and small business owners and certain freelancers can get up to a 20% deduction on business profits. For example, if you make $190,000 in business income through an LLC, sole proprietorship, S Corp, or any entity with a pass-through income, your total tax owed is $29,522. If you made that at a job, you would owe $36,888 on federal income tax alone. So if you're able to understand how the system is set up and how it incentivizes different people to make money, you're going to be much better off. Follow me if you want a part two of this.

And this is typically the largest holding of any portfolio that I start and it's up 80% in the past five years. Next, I would add $200 of QQQ. That's the ETF giving you exposure to tech and software companies. It's done really well in the past five years, plus 128%. Then I would put $300 into individual stocks. So I would choose three stocks and put $100 into each of them. You want companies that will be around in 40 years. So think of your Apples, your Googles, or your JP Morgans of the world. It's important to not buy any penny stocks. My last $100 is staying in a high yield savings account in cash, waiting for opportunities. And I think this split provides a lot of diversification to stocks via ETFs, as well as you get some concentration into stable long-term companies.

Jetsuite X is the airline that lets you fly semi-privately and for this comparison I flew between LA and San Francisco and I started my timer when the airline announced boarding. For my United flight it took 54 minutes after they announced boarding for us to take off and after a 52 minute flight time I finally got out. All right just got out of the plane two hours and five minutes and about four seconds. Before I reveal how much time JSX saves let's look at the fare difference. For United I paid $135 for my flight to LA and Jetsuite X was $299 for one way. So is the time savings worth the cost? We're gonna break that down but first here's how long it took me. It took one hour and 37 minutes on Jetsuite X for the same segment thereby saving me about 28 minutes. Since the fare difference was $163 to save about a half hour if you value your time and around $330 per hour JSX becomes worth it on just the boarding 2D planning process. I'd also estimate you save about an hour each way because you have light security, you can arrive 20 minutes before your flight, and you don't have to navigate any terminals. Of course this is dependent on how early you get to the airport etc but I'm gonna leave up a breakdown of my times in particular and if you like this video make sure to follow me for more.

First, you wanna pick a brokerage you're comfortable with like Fidelity, Schwab, or M1 Finance and click open an account. Click on retirement and IRAs and then right here, you'll wanna choose open a Roth IRA. Then you need to fill out this. It's some basic information like your name, address, et cetera In your IRA dashboard, make sure to click contribute now. Once you connect your bank account, you can contribute to the Roth IRA. Now the contribution limit, I don't know if you can see this is $7,000 per year or $8,000 per year if you're over the age of 50. Personally, I would just automate it with a monthly recurring transaction of around 300 to $500 per month. Once you have some money in your Roth IRA, you wanna buy some index funds that will grow over time. So the S&P 500 has been growing 8% to 10% annually since it was started. Ticker symbols for that include VOO, SPY, FX, AIX, as well as VFIX. If you get average returns in the market for 40 years, your future balance is going to be $2.365 million. And the crazy part is is that you only contributed about $280,000, the rest is your return. Make sure to follow me for more finance videos like these on your page.

Created on 2025-02-04 17:45:24+00:00) This is how much I made in interest in my high yield savings account for the last three months. Now this includes my emergency fund as well as my savings for a down payment on a future house. So I personally keep about six months of expenses in an emergency fund. And for me, that looks like about $30,000 which I know sounds like a little bit on the high end but I like that peace of mind and it's about 5K a month. Then I have about 132K that I've been accumulating over the years as extra money for a down payment or investment property. I don't wanna invest these funds since I actually might need them soon. So therefore it just stays in my high yield account. In February, I made about $577. Now in January, I made $633.05. And in December, I made $630.15. The reason for the decrease recently is that the Federal Reserve lowered their interest rates a couple months ago. So my January interest was a tad lower. Still though, I get about a 4.5% return on my high yield savings through Wealthfront. And I love the fact that I got paid around $1,840 extra these past three months for literally doing nothing, just existing.

Created on 2025-02-03 15:37:35+00:00) President Trump officially imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, as well as 10% on Chinese goods over the weekend. The market today is reacting awfully because of it. As you can see, everything's in the red. Economists have predicted that tariffs will cause inflation and lower GDP growth, but why do tariffs cause inflation and should we be worried? If a toy costs $10 and Walmart imports it from say Canada, Walmart will now have to pay an extra $2.50 to US customs, thus probably passing on that cost likely to customers. A tariff then would incentivize the US based supplier like Walmart to seek out American made toys instead of Canadian ones. This will also hurt Canada and Mexico's economy way more than it hurts the United States, because currently nearly 80% of both Canada and Mexico's exports go to United States. On the US side, about 16% of US exports go to Canada and Mexico respectively. I think this is just a negotiation tactic by Trump because Canada and Mexico won't be able to sustain this for a long period of time. Both of their economies are more reliant on the US than the US is reliant on them. Now, will the real impact of these tariffs last? Well, I definitely could see GDP being affected as well as inflation. However, I do think that Trump knew all of these things going into it. If you're investing for the long term, such as your retirement, I don't think you need to do anything. Don't abandon your investing plans. However, if you are invested for the short term, such as the next few months, I don't think these tariff issues will be solved until at least the end of Q1. What do you think? Let me know in the comments.

It depends entirely on how long you hold the stock as well as if you actually sold the stock. You'll owe taxes when you realize the profit, so that's when you actually sell the stock for a gain. So let's say you sell Apple stock and you realize a $10,000 gain in profit. If you held it for less than one year, you will owe short-term capital gains taxes, and that is taxed at your federal marginal tax rate. So if you make $120,000 per year, that puts you in the 24% marginal tax bracket, that means you will owe $2,400 in taxes on the gain of 10,000. If you're able to hold it for more than a year, your long-term capital gains rate then becomes 0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on your income. In this case, you would owe $1,500 in taxes if you sold it after owning it for more than one year. Now, keep in mind, if you just buy and hold and you don't sell at all, then you don't owe any taxes yet. It's only when you sell the stock.

Well, new, it's going to cost you $45,950, but you should never buy it new because after one year, the resale value is 21% less or $36,000. Cars are depreciating assets, which means that they lose value over time. If you Google car depreciation curve, you can see that all of them go downwards, but we can actually use this to save money. To get the most value, we wanna buy a car after the fourth year of depreciation. That's a used car sweet spot. In the case of the BMW, if you wait four years, that car's only gonna cost you $27,000 or about 51% less. I like to buy a car that's three to four years used, maybe has 15 to 20,000 miles on it, and is perhaps a lease turn back, and then I'm gonna buy it in cash. Follow me for more.

Number one is to start a budget and track how much you spend. Now, a good rule of thumb is to use the 50-30-20 rule. That's where 50% of your budget goes towards needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings. Second is to write down your net worth every quarter or every year to see if it's trending in the right direction. Personally, I tally all my bank accounts and investment accounts, and then I subtract any liabilities or debt that I have, and I try to track it on a regular basis. This habit increases your net worth because you're now paying attention to it, and I'll have a free net worth tracker for you guys down below. Number three is to invest your money and get it to work for you. I talk a lot about investing on this page, but by doing so, you're ensuring that your money isn't just sitting there losing value to inflation. If you're just getting started, putting money into index funds like the S&P 500 are a great way to start, so ticker symbols VOO or SPY. Let me know down below your net worth if you're comfortable in the comments.

Assuming you save 10K per year at a 7% return, it takes you 7.84 years to hit your first 100K, but the next 100K, since your money is working for you, would take you 5.1 years. Fast forward, and we can see that all subsequent 100K increments, each one is faster than the previous. You have money working for you and it's continuing to compound, and as you invest, it's like rolling a giant snowball down the hill. Look at the time between the 400K and 500K mark. You can see it's 2.5 years, and comparing that to the first 100K, it's a lot faster, but don't worry, it gets crazier still. By the time you're approaching the $1 million mark from the $900,000 mark, it's only going to take you 1.35 years for that same 100K. The first 100K takes you 25.5% of the total time it takes to get to a million dollars. The remaining 900K only takes 74.5% of the time, so that's pretty funny. It's like when you hit 100K, you're basically a quarter of the way to a million dollars. I know that sounds weird, but in terms of time, it's true.

It's the number one app in the top free apps. They released an AI model last week that basically rivals LLMs like ChadGBT, and it was created for a fraction of the cost. They claim around $6 million. Investors are worried because it was created without access to NVIDIA's most powerful chips, and NVIDIA's growth and share price relies on the AI industry actually needing those chips. Basically, current market and price levels are super reliant on future AI profits as well as the industry growing. DeepSeek is a huge threat to all that because if some startup from China can come in and do it for a very limited budget without the need for these chips, then the entire AI industry is now called into question. I do feel like the stock price of NVIDIA today seems like an overreaction, but valuations were high already, as you can see, and the S&P 500 is still overvalued compared to what it typically is. And some people on the internet don't believe that it only costs $6 million. Personally, I'm a little skeptical as well, but until we find out more, I'm not entirely sure that this is the end of the AI industry just yet.

There are three big reasons why that could happen. Now, the first is lifestyle inflation. So in this book, The Millionaire Next Door, the author found that people who often look well off are usually deeply in debt. Physicians and lawyers, for example, usually earn above average incomes, but they also tend to drive luxury cars and live in larger homes because they want to live in the same neighborhoods that their colleagues do. Common mistake number two is being burdened by too much debt. So if your friend has $5,000 in credit card debt for just one year, that's $5,000 they aren't investing. In that single year alone, that $5,000 could grow to over $50,000 in 30 years. Third, there's a lack of tracking or budgeting the money itself. So it's really easy to spend frivolously without knowing the full repercussions of how much you're spending versus how much you're not. If you track your money, you'll have a clear understanding of where your money is going and you won't be as likely to overspend. Do you know anyone that makes a good income yet they're broke? Let me know down below.

Created on 2025-01-26 00:02:09+00:00) You're gonna make your first 100K, it's not gonna come from investing, and that's something that people don't get. Pretend you get average gains in the market of 8% per year and start with $10,000, it would still take you 30 years to hit $100,000 just investing that sum, and nobody wants to wait that long. Charlie Munger, who was Warren Buffet's right-hand man, said it best, the first $100,000 is a bitch, but you gotta do it, I don't care what you have to do. So your first $100,000 actually comes mostly from saving every dollar and investing on top of that. If you save 12K a year for seven years at a 4.5% return, you will have $100,000, but look, 84% of it came from savings, and only 16% of it came from the interest in gains. A lot of the friction in building wealth is at the beginning of the journey, so every dollar when you're starting out saving matters that much more. I hope this helps.

So you gotta make sure you're protecting your money against inflation, and here are three options. Number one is just investing. The easiest way to beat the inflation rate is to invest in the market. So on average, the stock market returns about eight to 10% per year. And if you invest in index funds, you can buy the entire market just with one purchase. The second are treasury inflation protected securities, also known as TIPS. Now, these are government bonds that adjust their principal value with inflation. These aren't perfect by any means, but currently they provide around a 2.2% return above the inflation rate. Number three, you could consider real estate, which generally appreciates over time. Now, keep in mind that this isn't perfect either, but in general, property values and rental income tend to rise with inflation. As long as your money is working for you somehow, it's better than keeping it in a bank account that yields 0.01%. An easy option anybody can do is a high yield savings account for the time being while they pay about 4% per year.

First option are index funds and ETFs tracking the S&P 500. These are low to medium risk over a long-term time horizon and you'll set it and forget it. And it should on average return about 8 to 10% per year. Second, you could go with a three fund portfolio. That's where you have a US stock market index fund, an international stock market index fund and a bond fund. This is more diversified than the first option. So lower risk in general and is overall a solid choice. Third are individual stocks, especially mega caps. Since the Roth IRA gives you tax-free gains, you wanna take full advantage of that with holdings that have high upside. These are riskier, but having a few positions of companies of the caliber of Apple, Google, or Amazon could be good. $1,000 in Apple stock 20 years ago is worth more than $700,000 today. And if you invested in a Roth IRA, then all of those gains would be tax-free. That's the power of it.

In the 1980s, the DynaTAC was rolled out costing $3,995 and you'd get around 30 minutes of talk time and it's projected that those plans cost a few hundred dollars per month. Now in the 1990s, the Bureau of Labor Statistics cited cell services costing around $50 per month with limited talk time and some data usage. Now in the 2000s, the cost of cell phone services ranged but you could get your phone covered for about $30 per month. As more competitors entered the market, prices went down. However, by the 2010s, the introduction of smartphones and data plans meant that cell phone plans started to cost an average of $113 per month for one line with unlimited data, talk and text. But what if you could pay only $25 per month? Metro offers just that with their BYOD or bring your own phone plan. All you have to do is bring the phone you want to add the service to and pay $25 per month. You get unlimited 5G on one line with no contracts or credit checks.

This is going to be the foundation of your portfolio and it's up 83% in the past five years. Second, I'm adding another $3,000 into QQQ. That's the ETF that gives you exposure to the software and tech companies. And in the past five years, it's up 135%. Third, I'm going to add $2,000 into a high yield savings account. And that way I always have some cash on hand in case there are any opportunities to buy up any dips. Let me know if you have any questions. I'll also have some free downloads in my profile.

Bitcoin is the guy that microdoses LSD for breakfast, he lives in an apartment that looks like this, and one day he's spending 5k at the club, but then the next day he's asking you for money. He talks about changing the system, but he can't even commit to dinner plans. Financial stocks are like artists full of potential, one year they can be flying you around the world because they're mega successful, but then society kind of weighs a little bit heavier on them, they're a little bit sensitive, so when people start to talk bad about them, they go into a dark, deep depression, and their stock price falls because of it too. Gold is the old money guy and talks about legacy, he's reliable in tough times, goes skiing in Aspen, and he's going to be happy when everyone else is miserable. And it's especially true when times are tough in the world.

The price alone doesn't tell you much, but investors can use something called the PE ratio. That stands for price to earnings, and it's one of the stats you can use to value a company across similar companies. Let me explain. For 10, we have a burger shop called Al's Burgers. They trade for $20 per share on the stock market, and their earnings per share is $2. So therefore, investors are currently paying $10 for every $1 of earnings they generate, meaning that's a PE ratio of 10. Now, Bob's Burgers enters the chat, and their share price is also $20. They're actually much more profitable though, and their earnings per share is $4. That means people are currently paying $5 for every $1 of earnings, or a PE ratio of five. So Al's has a much higher stock price relative to how much they actually earn, so that could mean they're overvalued relative to Bob's Burgers. So Bob's is comparably the better deal. PE ratios vary across all types of industries and companies, so you always need to compare within the same industry. In the case of Apple versus Google, Google trades at a 24 PE compared to Apple's 36.98, so there may be an argument that Google is undervalued relatively to Apple. However, there's much more to investing than just one stat, and I'm gonna make more videos on it, so make sure to follow me for more.

For stocks, the S&P 500 has averaged 10% per year since 1925 or the past 100 years or so. Real estate, however, has returned about 4.2% since 1928, according to the latest data from NYU Stern. With real estate, it's more common to use leverage to multiply returns, as well as there are depreciation strategies to increase your overall return as well. Lastly, crypto. Oh boy, Bitcoin has exploded 100,000% since 2010, but of course it comes with a ton of extreme volatility. It experienced a minus 84% drop from December 2017 to December 2018, which wiped out a lot of crypto investors. There are pros and cons to each of these, but which one are you choosing? Let me know in the comments.

It comes down to the idea that demand for gas is what's called inelastic. Gas is an item people buy that just doesn't have many substitutes. When prices of goods go up, the demand for it should decrease. But with inelastic demand, when the price of gas, say, goes up, the quantity demanded just decreases by a smaller percentage. Demand is relatively unresponsive to price changes in the case of gas because people need this item to drive, even if prices go up. Other goods that are like this could include eggs and milk. But what about goods that are elastic? In other words, they act the opposite. These are much more common and refer to anything that you buy much less of just because the price went up. So if price goes up, demand goes down a lot. Examples include luxury cars, designer clothing, airline tickets, or even concerts. Pricing is super fascinating when it comes to business and economics because if you price something incorrectly, your business could fail. But if the price is right, you could thrive.

But a common mistake people make is that they believe that their entire income is now taxed at 22%, leaving them to make less money, which is just not true. Here's how it actually works. In the first tax bracket, any amount of money you make up to $11,925 per year is taxed at 10%. Then the amount of money you make from 11,926 to 48,745 is taxed at 12%. You see, only dollars that you make in that corresponding bracket are taxed at that rate. In the case of the raise, you'll only pay 22% in taxes on any dollars above 48,476. So for a $50,000 salary, that means only 1524 of it is taxed at 22%. The rest of your salary is taxed at those lower rates, giving you an effective total rate of 12.1%. So making more money is always better. If you enjoy videos about finance and investing, follow me for more.

Number one is that investment income is taxed wildly differently than at your job. So if you make $100,000 in investment income, you'll get taxed at long-term capital gains rates or 15%, $15,000. That same $100,000 in a salary job, you're paying 22.4% in total tax. So what does that tell you? You should probably invest. Number two, any Roth retirement accounts. So these are accounts where all your profits that you make are tax-free and they're so overpowered that the government only lets you put in $7,000 per year if you're under the age of 50 or 8K per year over the age of 50. And number three, QBI deductions. America always encourages small businesses and small business owners and certain freelancers can get up to a 20% deduction on business profits. For example, if you make $190,000 in business income through an LLC, sole proprietorship, S Corp, or any entity with a pass-through income, your total tax owed is $29,522. If you made that at a job, you would owe $36,888 on federal income tax alone. So if you're able to understand how the system is set up and how it incentivizes different people to make money, you're going to be much better off. Follow me if you want a part two of this.

And this is typically the largest holding of any portfolio that I start and it's up 80% in the past five years. Next, I would add $200 of QQQ. That's the ETF giving you exposure to tech and software companies. It's done really well in the past five years, plus 128%. Then I would put $300 into individual stocks. So I would choose three stocks and put $100 into each of them. You want companies that will be around in 40 years. So think of your Apples, your Googles, or your JP Morgans of the world. It's important to not buy any penny stocks. My last $100 is staying in a high yield savings account in cash, waiting for opportunities. And I think this split provides a lot of diversification to stocks via ETFs, as well as you get some concentration into stable long-term companies.

Jetsuite X is the airline that lets you fly semi-privately and for this comparison I flew between LA and San Francisco and I started my timer when the airline announced boarding. For my United flight it took 54 minutes after they announced boarding for us to take off and after a 52 minute flight time I finally got out. All right just got out of the plane two hours and five minutes and about four seconds. Before I reveal how much time JSX saves let's look at the fare difference. For United I paid $135 for my flight to LA and Jetsuite X was $299 for one way. So is the time savings worth the cost? We're gonna break that down but first here's how long it took me. It took one hour and 37 minutes on Jetsuite X for the same segment thereby saving me about 28 minutes. Since the fare difference was $163 to save about a half hour if you value your time and around $330 per hour JSX becomes worth it on just the boarding 2D planning process. I'd also estimate you save about an hour each way because you have light security, you can arrive 20 minutes before your flight, and you don't have to navigate any terminals. Of course this is dependent on how early you get to the airport etc but I'm gonna leave up a breakdown of my times in particular and if you like this video make sure to follow me for more.

First, you wanna pick a brokerage you're comfortable with like Fidelity, Schwab, or M1 Finance and click open an account. Click on retirement and IRAs and then right here, you'll wanna choose open a Roth IRA. Then you need to fill out this. It's some basic information like your name, address, et cetera In your IRA dashboard, make sure to click contribute now. Once you connect your bank account, you can contribute to the Roth IRA. Now the contribution limit, I don't know if you can see this is $7,000 per year or $8,000 per year if you're over the age of 50. Personally, I would just automate it with a monthly recurring transaction of around 300 to $500 per month. Once you have some money in your Roth IRA, you wanna buy some index funds that will grow over time. So the S&P 500 has been growing 8% to 10% annually since it was started. Ticker symbols for that include VOO, SPY, FX, AIX, as well as VFIX. If you get average returns in the market for 40 years, your future balance is going to be $2.365 million. And the crazy part is is that you only contributed about $280,000, the rest is your return. Make sure to follow me for more finance videos like these on your page.

Created on 2025-02-04 17:45:24+00:00) This is how much I made in interest in my high yield savings account for the last three months. Now this includes my emergency fund as well as my savings for a down payment on a future house. So I personally keep about six months of expenses in an emergency fund. And for me, that looks like about $30,000 which I know sounds like a little bit on the high end but I like that peace of mind and it's about 5K a month. Then I have about 132K that I've been accumulating over the years as extra money for a down payment or investment property. I don't wanna invest these funds since I actually might need them soon. So therefore it just stays in my high yield account. In February, I made about $577. Now in January, I made $633.05. And in December, I made $630.15. The reason for the decrease recently is that the Federal Reserve lowered their interest rates a couple months ago. So my January interest was a tad lower. Still though, I get about a 4.5% return on my high yield savings through Wealthfront. And I love the fact that I got paid around $1,840 extra these past three months for literally doing nothing, just existing.

Created on 2025-02-03 15:37:35+00:00) President Trump officially imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, as well as 10% on Chinese goods over the weekend. The market today is reacting awfully because of it. As you can see, everything's in the red. Economists have predicted that tariffs will cause inflation and lower GDP growth, but why do tariffs cause inflation and should we be worried? If a toy costs $10 and Walmart imports it from say Canada, Walmart will now have to pay an extra $2.50 to US customs, thus probably passing on that cost likely to customers. A tariff then would incentivize the US based supplier like Walmart to seek out American made toys instead of Canadian ones. This will also hurt Canada and Mexico's economy way more than it hurts the United States, because currently nearly 80% of both Canada and Mexico's exports go to United States. On the US side, about 16% of US exports go to Canada and Mexico respectively. I think this is just a negotiation tactic by Trump because Canada and Mexico won't be able to sustain this for a long period of time. Both of their economies are more reliant on the US than the US is reliant on them. Now, will the real impact of these tariffs last? Well, I definitely could see GDP being affected as well as inflation. However, I do think that Trump knew all of these things going into it. If you're investing for the long term, such as your retirement, I don't think you need to do anything. Don't abandon your investing plans. However, if you are invested for the short term, such as the next few months, I don't think these tariff issues will be solved until at least the end of Q1. What do you think? Let me know in the comments.

Created on 2025-02-02 19:04:09+00:00) If you make $10,000 in profit on Apple stock, do you know how much tax you would have to pay? It depends entirely on how long you hold the stock as well as if you actually sold the stock. You'll owe taxes when you realize the profit, so that's when you actually sell the stock for a gain. So let's say you sell Apple stock and you realize a $10,000 gain in profit. If you held it for less than one year, you will owe short-term capital gains taxes, and that is taxed at your federal marginal tax rate. So if you make $120,000 per year, that puts you in the 24% marginal tax bracket, that means you will owe $2,400 in taxes on the gain of 10,000. If you're able to hold it for more than a year, your long-term capital gains rate then becomes 0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on your income. In this case, you would owe $1,500 in taxes if you sold it after owning it for more than one year. Now, keep in mind, if you just buy and hold and you don't sell at all, then you don't owe any taxes yet. It's only when you sell the stock.

Well, new, it's going to cost you $45,950, but you should never buy it new because after one year, the resale value is 21% less or $36,000. Cars are depreciating assets, which means that they lose value over time. If you Google car depreciation curve, you can see that all of them go downwards, but we can actually use this to save money. To get the most value, we wanna buy a car after the fourth year of depreciation. That's a used car sweet spot. In the case of the BMW, if you wait four years, that car's only gonna cost you $27,000 or about 51% less. I like to buy a car that's three to four years used, maybe has 15 to 20,000 miles on it, and is perhaps a lease turn back, and then I'm gonna buy it in cash. Follow me for more.

Number one is to start a budget and track how much you spend. Now, a good rule of thumb is to use the 50-30-20 rule. That's where 50% of your budget goes towards needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings. Second is to write down your net worth every quarter or every year to see if it's trending in the right direction. Personally, I tally all my bank accounts and investment accounts, and then I subtract any liabilities or debt that I have, and I try to track it on a regular basis. This habit increases your net worth because you're now paying attention to it, and I'll have a free net worth tracker for you guys down below. Number three is to invest your money and get it to work for you. I talk a lot about investing on this page, but by doing so, you're ensuring that your money isn't just sitting there losing value to inflation. If you're just getting started, putting money into index funds like the S&P 500 are a great way to start, so ticker symbols VOO or SPY. Let me know down below your net worth if you're comfortable in the comments.

Created on 2025-01-28 21:20:44+00:00) If you're able to make your first 100K, the next 100K is a lot easier. Assuming you save 10K per year at a 7% return, it takes you 7.84 years to hit your first 100K, but the next 100K, since your money is working for you, would take you 5.1 years. Fast forward, and we can see that all subsequent 100K increments, each one is faster than the previous. You have money working for you and it's continuing to compound, and as you invest, it's like rolling a giant snowball down the hill. Look at the time between the 400K and 500K mark. You can see it's 2.5 years, and comparing that to the first 100K, it's a lot faster, but don't worry, it gets crazier still. By the time you're approaching the $1 million mark from the $900,000 mark, it's only going to take you 1.35 years for that same 100K. The first 100K takes you 25.5% of the total time it takes to get to a million dollars. The remaining 900K only takes 74.5% of the time, so that's pretty funny. It's like when you hit 100K, you're basically a quarter of the way to a million dollars. I know that sounds weird, but in terms of time, it's true.

Created on 2025-01-27 20:04:39+00:00) Tech and AI stocks are tanking hard today with NVIDIA down over 15%. And the reason is because of Chinese startup DeepSeek. It's the number one app in the top free apps. They released an AI model last week that basically rivals LLMs like ChadGBT, and it was created for a fraction of the cost. They claim around $6 million. Investors are worried because it was created without access to NVIDIA's most powerful chips, and NVIDIA's growth and share price relies on the AI industry actually needing those chips. Basically, current market and price levels are super reliant on future AI profits as well as the industry growing. DeepSeek is a huge threat to all that because if some startup from China can come in and do it for a very limited budget without the need for these chips, then the entire AI industry is now called into question. I do feel like the stock price of NVIDIA today seems like an overreaction, but valuations were high already, as you can see, and the S&P 500 is still overvalued compared to what it typically is. And some people on the internet don't believe that it only costs $6 million. Personally, I'm a little skeptical as well, but until we find out more, I'm not entirely sure that this is the end of the AI industry just yet.

There are three big reasons why that could happen. Now, the first is lifestyle inflation. So in this book, The Millionaire Next Door, the author found that people who often look well off are usually deeply in debt. Physicians and lawyers, for example, usually earn above average incomes, but they also tend to drive luxury cars and live in larger homes because they want to live in the same neighborhoods that their colleagues do. Common mistake number two is being burdened by too much debt. So if your friend has $5,000 in credit card debt for just one year, that's $5,000 they aren't investing. In that single year alone, that $5,000 could grow to over $50,000 in 30 years. Third, there's a lack of tracking or budgeting the money itself. So it's really easy to spend frivolously without knowing the full repercussions of how much you're spending versus how much you're not. If you track your money, you'll have a clear understanding of where your money is going and you won't be as likely to overspend. Do you know anyone that makes a good income yet they're broke? Let me know down below.

Created on 2025-01-26 00:02:09+00:00) You're gonna make your first 100K, it's not gonna come from investing, and that's something that people don't get. Pretend you get average gains in the market of 8% per year and start with $10,000, it would still take you 30 years to hit $100,000 just investing that sum, and nobody wants to wait that long. Charlie Munger, who was Warren Buffet's right-hand man, said it best, the first $100,000 is a bitch, but you gotta do it, I don't care what you have to do. So your first $100,000 actually comes mostly from saving every dollar and investing on top of that. If you save 12K a year for seven years at a 4.5% return, you will have $100,000, but look, 84% of it came from savings, and only 16% of it came from the interest in gains. A lot of the friction in building wealth is at the beginning of the journey, so every dollar when you're starting out saving matters that much more. I hope this helps.

So you gotta make sure you're protecting your money against inflation, and here are three options. Number one is just investing. The easiest way to beat the inflation rate is to invest in the market. So on average, the stock market returns about eight to 10% per year. And if you invest in index funds, you can buy the entire market just with one purchase. The second are treasury inflation protected securities, also known as TIPS. Now, these are government bonds that adjust their principal value with inflation. These aren't perfect by any means, but currently they provide around a 2.2% return above the inflation rate. Number three, you could consider real estate, which generally appreciates over time. Now, keep in mind that this isn't perfect either, but in general, property values and rental income tend to rise with inflation. As long as your money is working for you somehow, it's better than keeping it in a bank account that yields 0.01%. An easy option anybody can do is a high yield savings account for the time being while they pay about 4% per year.

Created on 2025-01-22 22:12:50+00:00) Everyone tells you to get a Roth IRA, but no one tells you what to invest in. Here are three options to invest in with the riskiest one being last. First option are index funds and ETFs tracking the S&P 500. These are low to medium risk over a long-term time horizon and you'll set it and forget it. And it should on average return about 8 to 10% per year. Second, you could go with a three fund portfolio. That's where you have a US stock market index fund, an international stock market index fund and a bond fund. This is more diversified than the first option. So lower risk in general and is overall a solid choice. Third are individual stocks, especially mega caps. Since the Roth IRA gives you tax-free gains, you wanna take full advantage of that with holdings that have high upside. These are riskier, but having a few positions of companies of the caliber of Apple, Google, or Amazon could be good. $1,000 in Apple stock 20 years ago is worth more than $700,000 today. And if you invested in a Roth IRA, then all of those gains would be tax-free. That's the power of it.

Created on 2025-01-22 18:01:24+00:00) Here's what cell phone service bills were in the 1980s to today and how they've changed. In the 1980s, the DynaTAC was rolled out costing $3,995 and you'd get around 30 minutes of talk time and it's projected that those plans cost a few hundred dollars per month. Now in the 1990s, the Bureau of Labor Statistics cited cell services costing around $50 per month with limited talk time and some data usage. Now in the 2000s, the cost of cell phone services ranged but you could get your phone covered for about $30 per month. As more competitors entered the market, prices went down. However, by the 2010s, the introduction of smartphones and data plans meant that cell phone plans started to cost an average of $113 per month for one line with unlimited data, talk and text. But what if you could pay only $25 per month? Metro offers just that with their BYOD or bring your own phone plan. All you have to do is bring the phone you want to add the service to and pay $25 per month. You get unlimited 5G on one line with no contracts or credit checks.

Created on 2025-01-21 19:37:15+00:00) is how I would invest $10,000 if I were starting all over again. First, I'd invest $5,000 into an S&P 500 ETF like VOO or SPY. This is going to be the foundation of your portfolio and it's up 83% in the past five years. Second, I'm adding another $3,000 into QQQ. That's the ETF that gives you exposure to the software and tech companies. And in the past five years, it's up 135%. Third, I'm going to add $2,000 into a high yield savings account. And that way I always have some cash on hand in case there are any opportunities to buy up any dips. Let me know if you have any questions. I'll also have some free downloads in my profile.

Bitcoin is the guy that microdoses LSD for breakfast, he lives in an apartment that looks like this, and one day he's spending 5k at the club, but then the next day he's asking you for money. He talks about changing the system, but he can't even commit to dinner plans. Financial stocks are like artists full of potential, one year they can be flying you around the world because they're mega successful, but then society kind of weighs a little bit heavier on them, they're a little bit sensitive, so when people start to talk bad about them, they go into a dark, deep depression, and their stock price falls because of it too.

The price alone doesn't tell you much, but investors can use something called the PE ratio. That stands for price to earnings, and it's one of the stats you can use to value a company across similar companies. Let me explain. For 10, we have a burger shop called Al's Burgers. They trade for $20 per share on the stock market, and their earnings per share is $2. So therefore, investors are currently paying $10 for every $1 of earnings they generate, meaning that's a PE ratio of 10. Now, Bob's Burgers enters the chat, and their share price is also $20. They're actually much more profitable though, and their earnings per share is $4. That means people are currently paying $5 for every $1 of earnings, or a PE ratio of five. So Al's has a much higher stock price relative to how much they actually earn, so that could mean they're overvalued relative to Bob's Burgers. So Bob's is comparably the better deal. PE ratios vary across all types of industries and companies, so you always need to compare within the same industry. In the case of Apple versus Google, Google trades at a 24 PE compared to Apple's 36.98, so there may be an argument that Google is undervalued relatively to Apple. However, there's much more to investing than just one stat, and I'm gonna make more videos on it, so make sure to follow me for more.

Created on 2025-02-13 21:58:00+00:00) Stocks, real estate, or crypto, which one actually builds wealth faster? Let's break it down. For stocks, the S&P 500 has averaged 10% per year since 1925 or the past 100 years or so. Real estate, however, has returned about 4.2% since 1928, according to the latest data from NYU Stern. With real estate, it's more common to use leverage to multiply returns, as well as there are depreciation strategies to increase your overall return as well. Lastly, crypto. Oh boy, Bitcoin has exploded 100,000% since 2010, but of course it comes with a ton of extreme volatility. It experienced a minus 84% drop from December 2017 to December 2018, which wiped out a lot of crypto investors. There are pros and cons to each of these, but which one are you choosing? Let me know in the comments.

It comes down to the idea that demand for gas is what's called inelastic. Gas is an item people buy that just doesn't have many substitutes. When prices of goods go up, the demand for it should decrease. But with inelastic demand, when the price of gas, say, goes up, the quantity demanded just decreases by a smaller percentage. Demand is relatively unresponsive to price changes in the case of gas because people need this item to drive, even if prices go up. Other goods that are like this could include eggs and milk. But what about goods that are elastic? In other words, they act the opposite. These are much more common and refer to anything that you buy much less of just because the price went up. So if price goes up, demand goes down a lot. Examples include luxury cars, designer clothing, airline tickets, or even concerts. Pricing is super fascinating when it comes to business and economics because if you price something incorrectly, your business could fail. But if the price is right, you could thrive.

They launched SoFi Plus, which is America's most rewarding financial membership all in one app. SoFi Plus puts $1,000 plus in value in your pocket for only $10 a month. These features are crazy, like a 1% match on recurring deposits to SoFi Invest paid in rewards points, 10% boost on credit card cashback rewards, 3.80% APY on bank savings balances, unlimited one-on-one sessions with SoFi Wealth's financial planners, and all of these other benefits here. But the craziest part is to celebrate the launch, they're giving away a total of $600,000 in prizes to help give six people a chance to win a fast path to their financial dreams, and these prizes aren't your average pizza party. They're helping six winners with the money toward purchasing a home, getting their education paid down, going on a dream vacation, or retiring early and more. To enter for a chance to win, sign up for SoFi Plus by May 14th. You can get SoFi Plus for just $10 per month or at no cost if you sign up with direct deposit.

But a common mistake people make is that they believe that their entire income is now taxed at 22%, leaving them to make less money, which is just not true. Here's how it actually works. In the first tax bracket, any amount of money you make up to $11,925 per year is taxed at 10%. Then the amount of money you make from 11,926 to 48,745 is taxed at 12%. You see, only dollars that you make in that corresponding bracket are taxed at that rate. In the case of the raise, you'll only pay 22% in taxes on any dollars above 48,476. So for a $50,000 salary, that means only 1524 of it is taxed at 22%. The rest of your salary is taxed at those lower rates, giving you an effective total rate of 12.1%. So making more money is always better. If you enjoy videos about finance and investing, follow me for more.

Created on 2025-02-09 18:32:55+00:00) When government literally teaches you how to be rich, you just have to read between the lines and here are three methods. Number one is that investment income is taxed wildly differently than at your job. So if you make $100,000 in investment income, you'll get taxed at long-term capital gains rates or 15%, $15,000. That same $100,000 in a salary job, you're paying 22.4% in total tax. So what does that tell you? You should probably invest. Number two, any Roth retirement accounts. So these are accounts where all your profits that you make are tax-free and they're so overpowered that the government only lets you put in $7,000 per year if you're under the age of 50 or 8K per year over the age of 50. And number three, QBI deductions. America always encourages small businesses and small business owners and certain freelancers can get up to a 20% deduction on business profits. For example, if you make $190,000 in business income through an LLC, sole proprietorship, S Corp, or any entity with a pass-through income, your total tax owed is $29,522. If you made that at a job, you would owe $36,888 on federal income tax alone. So if you're able to understand how the system is set up and how it incentivizes different people to make money, you're going to be much better off. Follow me if you want a part two of this.

Created on 2025-02-07 22:45:50+00:00) This is how I would invest $1,000 if I were starting from scratch. First, I'd invest $400 into an S&P 500 ETF like VOO or SPY. And this is typically the largest holding of any portfolio that I start and it's up 80% in the past five years. Next, I would add $200 of QQQ. That's the ETF giving you exposure to tech and software companies. It's done really well in the past five years, plus 128%. Then I would put $300 into individual stocks. So I would choose three stocks and put $100 into each of them. You want companies that will be around in 40 years. So think of your Apples, your Googles, or your JP Morgans of the world. It's important to not buy any penny stocks. My last $100 is staying in a high yield savings account in cash, waiting for opportunities. And I think this split provides a lot of diversification to stocks via ETFs, as well as you get some concentration into stable long-term companies.

Jetsuite X is the airline that lets you fly semi-privately and for this comparison I flew between LA and San Francisco and I started my timer when the airline announced boarding. For my United flight it took 54 minutes after they announced boarding for us to take off and after a 52 minute flight time I finally got out. All right just got out of the plane two hours and five minutes and about four seconds. Before I reveal how much time JSX saves let's look at the fare difference. For United I paid $135 for my flight to LA and Jetsuite X was $299 for one way. So is the time savings worth the cost? We're gonna break that down but first here's how long it took me. It took one hour and 37 minutes on Jetsuite X for the same segment thereby saving me about 28 minutes. Since the fare difference was $163 to save about a half hour if you value your time and around $330 per hour JSX becomes worth it on just the boarding 2D planning process. I'd also estimate you save about an hour each way because you have light security, you can arrive 20 minutes before your flight, and you don't have to navigate any terminals. Of course this is dependent on how early you get to the airport etc but I'm gonna leave up a breakdown of my times in particular and if you like this video make sure to follow me for more.

First, you wanna pick a brokerage you're comfortable with like Fidelity, Schwab, or M1 Finance and click open an account. Click on retirement and IRAs and then right here, you'll wanna choose open a Roth IRA. Then you need to fill out this. It's some basic information like your name, address, et cetera In your IRA dashboard, make sure to click contribute now. Once you connect your bank account, you can contribute to the Roth IRA. Now the contribution limit, I don't know if you can see this is $7,000 per year or $8,000 per year if you're over the age of 50. Personally, I would just automate it with a monthly recurring transaction of around 300 to $500 per month. Once you have some money in your Roth IRA, you wanna buy some index funds that will grow over time. So the S&P 500 has been growing 8% to 10% annually since it was started. Ticker symbols for that include VOO, SPY, FX, AIX, as well as VFIX. If you get average returns in the market for 40 years, your future balance is going to be $2.365 million. And the crazy part is is that you only contributed about $280,000, the rest is your return. Make sure to follow me for more finance videos like these on your page.

Created on 2025-02-04 17:45:24+00:00) This is how much I made in interest in my high yield savings account for the last three months. Now this includes my emergency fund as well as my savings for a down payment on a future house. So I personally keep about six months of expenses in an emergency fund. And for me, that looks like about $30,000 which I know sounds like a little bit on the high end but I like that peace of mind and it's about 5K a month. Then I have about 132K that I've been accumulating over the years as extra money for a down payment or investment property. I don't wanna invest these funds since I actually might need them soon. So therefore it just stays in my high yield account. In February, I made about $577. Now in January, I made $633.05. And in December, I made $630.15. The reason for the decrease recently is that the Federal Reserve lowered their interest rates a couple months ago. So my January interest was a tad lower. Still though, I get about a 4.5% return on my high yield savings through Wealthfront. And I love the fact that I got paid around $1,840 extra these past three months for literally doing nothing, just existing.

Created on 2025-02-03 15:37:35+00:00) President Trump officially imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, as well as 10% on Chinese goods over the weekend. The market today is reacting awfully because of it. As you can see, everything's in the red. Economists have predicted that tariffs will cause inflation and lower GDP growth, but why do tariffs cause inflation and should we be worried? If a toy costs $10 and Walmart imports it from say Canada, Walmart will now have to pay an extra $2.50 to US customs, thus probably passing on that cost likely to customers. A tariff then would incentivize the US based supplier like Walmart to seek out American made toys instead of Canadian ones. This will also hurt Canada and Mexico's economy way more than it hurts the United States, because currently nearly 80% of both Canada and Mexico's exports go to United States. On the US side, about 16% of US exports go to Canada and Mexico respectively. I think this is just a negotiation tactic by Trump because Canada and Mexico won't be able to sustain this for a long period of time. Both of their economies are more reliant on the US than the US is reliant on them. Now, will the real impact of these tariffs last? Well, I definitely could see GDP being affected as well as inflation. However, I do think that Trump knew all of these things going into it. If you're investing for the long term, such as your retirement, I don't think you need to do anything. Don't abandon your investing plans. However, if you are invested for the short term, such as the next few months, I don't think these tariff issues will be solved until at least the end of Q1. What do you think? Let me know in the comments.

Created on 2025-02-02 19:04:09+00:00) If you make $10,000 in profit on Apple stock, do you know how much tax you would have to pay? It depends entirely on how long you hold the stock as well as if you actually sold the stock. You'll owe taxes when you realize the profit, so that's when you actually sell the stock for a gain. So let's say you sell Apple stock and you realize a $10,000 gain in profit. If you held it for less than one year, you will owe short-term capital gains taxes, and that is taxed at your federal marginal tax rate. So if you make $120,000 per year, that puts you in the 24% marginal tax bracket, that means you will owe $2,400 in taxes on the gain of 10,000. If you're able to hold it for more than a year, your long-term capital gains rate then becomes 0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on your income. In this case, you would owe $1,500 in taxes if you sold it after owning it for more than one year. Now, keep in mind, if you just buy and hold and you don't sell at all, then you don't owe any taxes yet. It's only when you sell the stock.

Created on 2025-02-01 20:11:46+00:00) Let's say you want this BMW 3 Series. Well, new, it's going to cost you $45,950, but you should never buy it new because after one year, the resale value is 21% less or $36,000. Cars are depreciating assets, which means that they lose value over time. If you Google car depreciation curve, you can see that all of them go downwards, but we can actually use this to save money. To get the most value, we wanna buy a car after the fourth year of depreciation. That's a used car sweet spot. In the case of the BMW, if you wait four years, that car's only gonna cost you $27,000 or about 51% less. I like to buy a car that's three to four years used, maybe has 15 to 20,000 miles on it, and is perhaps a lease turn back, and then I'm gonna buy it in cash. Follow me for more.

Created on 2025-01-30 19:30:40+00:00) This is the U.S. median net worth by age. Now, if you have less than this, you should do the following three things immediately. Number one is to start a budget and track how much you spend. Now, a good rule of thumb is to use the 50-30-20 rule. That's where 50% of your budget goes towards needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings. Second is to write down your net worth every quarter or every year to see if it's trending in the right direction. Personally, I tally all my bank accounts and investment accounts, and then I subtract any liabilities or debt that I have, and I try to track it on a regular basis. This habit increases your net worth because you're now paying attention to it, and I'll have a free net worth tracker for you guys down below. Number three is to invest your money and get it to work for you. I talk a lot about investing on this page, but by doing so, you're ensuring that your money isn't just sitting there losing value to inflation. If you're just getting started, putting money into index funds like the S&P 500 are a great way to start, so ticker symbols VOO or SPY. Let me know down below your net worth if you're comfortable in the comments.

Created on 2025-01-28 21:20:44+00:00) If you're able to make your first 100K, the next 100K is a lot easier. Assuming you save 10K per year at a 7% return, it takes you 7.84 years to hit your first 100K, but the next 100K, since your money is working for you, would take you 5.1 years. Fast forward, and we can see that all subsequent 100K increments, each one is faster than the previous. You have money working for you and it's continuing to compound, and as you invest, it's like rolling a giant snowball down the hill. Look at the time between the 400K and 500K mark. You can see it's 2.5 years, and comparing that to the first 100K, it's a lot faster, but don't worry, it gets crazier still. By the time you're approaching the $1 million mark from the $900,000 mark, it's only going to take you 1.35 years for that same 100K. The first 100K takes you 25.5% of the total time it takes to get to a million dollars. The remaining 900K only takes 74.5% of the time, so that's pretty funny. It's like when you hit 100K, you're basically a quarter of the way to a million dollars. I know that sounds weird, but in terms of time, it's true.

Created on 2025-01-27 20:04:39+00:00) Tech and AI stocks are tanking hard today with NVIDIA down over 15%. And the reason is because of Chinese startup DeepSeek. It's the number one app in the top free apps. They released an AI model last week that basically rivals LLMs like ChadGBT, and it was created for a fraction of the cost. They claim around $6 million. Investors are worried because it was created without access to NVIDIA's most powerful chips, and NVIDIA's growth and share price relies on the AI industry actually needing those chips. Basically, current market and price levels are super reliant on future AI profits as well as the industry growing. DeepSeek is a huge threat to all that because if some startup from China can come in and do it for a very limited budget without the need for these chips, then the entire AI industry is now called into question. I do feel like the stock price of NVIDIA today seems like an overreaction, but valuations were high already, as you can see, and the S&P 500 is still overvalued compared to what it typically is. And some people on the internet don't believe that it only costs $6 million. Personally, I'm a little skeptical as well, but until we find out more, I'm not entirely sure that this is the end of the AI industry just yet.

There are three big reasons why that could happen. Now, the first is lifestyle inflation. So in this book, The Millionaire Next Door, the author found that people who often look well off are usually deeply in debt. Physicians and lawyers, for example, usually earn above average incomes, but they also tend to drive luxury cars and live in larger homes because they want to live in the same neighborhoods that their colleagues do. Common mistake number two is being burdened by too much debt. So if your friend has $5,000 in credit card debt for just one year, that's $5,000 they aren't investing. In that single year alone, that $5,000 could grow to over $50,000 in 30 years. Third, there's a lack of tracking or budgeting the money itself. So it's really easy to spend frivolously without knowing the full repercussions of how much you're spending versus how much you're not. If you track your money, you'll have a clear understanding of where your money is going and you won't be as likely to overspend. Do you know anyone that makes a good income yet they're broke? Let me know down below.

Pretend you get average gains in the market of 8% per year and start with $10,000, it would still take you 30 years to hit $100,000 just investing that sum, and nobody wants to wait that long. Charlie Munger, who was Warren Buffet's right-hand man, said it best, the first $100,000 is a bitch, but you gotta do it, I don't care what you have to do. So your first $100,000 actually comes mostly from saving every dollar and investing on top of that. If you save 12K a year for seven years at a 4.5% return, you will have $100,000, but look, 84% of it came from savings, and only 16% of it came from the interest in gains. A lot of the friction in building wealth is at the beginning of the journey, so every dollar when you're starting out saving matters that much more. I hope this helps.

So you gotta make sure you're protecting your money against inflation, and here are three options. Number one is just investing. The easiest way to beat the inflation rate is to invest in the market. So on average, the stock market returns about eight to 10% per year. And if you invest in index funds, you can buy the entire market just with one purchase. The second are treasury inflation protected securities, also known as TIPS. Now, these are government bonds that adjust their principal value with inflation. These aren't perfect by any means, but currently they provide around a 2.2% return above the inflation rate. Number three, you could consider real estate, which generally appreciates over time. Now, keep in mind that this isn't perfect either, but in general, property values and rental income tend to rise with inflation. As long as your money is working for you somehow, it's better than keeping it in a bank account that yields 0.01%. An easy option anybody can do is a high yield savings account for the time being while they pay about 4% per year.

Created on 2025-01-22 22:12:50+00:00) Everyone tells you to get a Roth IRA, but no one tells you what to invest in. Here are three options to invest in with the riskiest one being last. First option are index funds and ETFs tracking the S&P 500. These are low to medium risk over a long-term time horizon and you'll set it and forget it. And it should on average return about 8 to 10% per year. Second, you could go with a three fund portfolio. That's where you have a US stock market index fund, an international stock market index fund and a bond fund. This is more diversified than the first option. So lower risk in general and is overall a solid choice. Third are individual stocks, especially mega caps. Since the Roth IRA gives you tax-free gains, you wanna take full advantage of that with holdings that have high upside. These are riskier, but having a few positions of companies of the caliber of Apple, Google, or Amazon could be good. $1,000 in Apple stock 20 years ago is worth more than $700,000 today. And if you invested in a Roth IRA, then all of those gains would be tax-free. That's the power of it.

Created on 2025-01-22 18:01:24+00:00) Here's what cell phone service bills were in the 1980s to today and how they've changed. In the 1980s, the DynaTAC was rolled out costing $3,995 and you'd get around 30 minutes of talk time and it's projected that those plans cost a few hundred dollars per month. Now in the 1990s, the Bureau of Labor Statistics cited cell services costing around $50 per month with limited talk time and some data usage. Now in the 2000s, the cost of cell phone services ranged but you could get your phone covered for about $30 per month. As more competitors entered the market, prices went down. However, by the 2010s, the introduction of smartphones and data plans meant that cell phone plans started to cost an average of $113 per month for one line with unlimited data, talk and text. But what if you could pay only $25 per month? Metro offers just that with their BYOD or bring your own phone plan. All you have to do is bring the phone you want to add the service to and pay $25 per month. You get unlimited 5G on one line with no contracts or credit checks.

Created on 2025-01-21 19:37:15+00:00) is how I would invest $10,000 if I were starting all over again. First, I'd invest $5,000 into an S&P 500 ETF like VOO or SPY. This is going to be the foundation of your portfolio and it's up 83% in the past five years. Second, I'm adding another $3,000 into QQQ. That's the ETF that gives you exposure to the software and tech companies. And in the past five years, it's up 135%. Third, I'm going to add $2,000 into a high yield savings account. And that way I always have some cash on hand in case there are any opportunities to buy up any dips. Let me know if you have any questions. I'll also have some free downloads in my profile.

Created on 2025-01-20 21:42:03+00:00) If investments were guys, ETFs would be the stable dudes that are always there for you, they're going to take you to the airport, they call you when they say they're going to call you, and they're always working on self-development, in fact they're growing at 8% per year, but they can be a little boring sometimes. Bitcoin is the guy that microdoses LSD for breakfast, he lives in an apartment that looks like this, and one day he's spending 5k at the club, but then the next day he's asking you for money. He talks about changing the system, but he can't even commit to dinner plans. Financial stocks are like artists full of potential, one year they can be flying you around the world because they're mega successful, but then society kind of weighs a little bit heavier on them, they're a little bit sensitive, so when people start to talk bad about them, they go into a dark, deep depression, and their stock price falls because of it too. Gold is the old money guy and talks about legacy, he's reliable in tough times, goes skiing in Aspen, and he's going to be happy when everyone else is miserable. And it's especially true when times are tough in the world.

The price alone doesn't tell you much, but investors can use something called the PE ratio. That stands for price to earnings, and it's one of the stats you can use to value a company across similar companies. Let me explain. For 10, we have a burger shop called Al's Burgers. They trade for $20 per share on the stock market, and their earnings per share is $2. So therefore, investors are currently paying $10 for every $1 of earnings they generate, meaning that's a PE ratio of 10. Now, Bob's Burgers enters the chat, and their share price is also $20. They're actually much more profitable though, and their earnings per share is $4. That means people are currently paying $5 for every $1 of earnings, or a PE ratio of five. So Al's has a much higher stock price relative to how much they actually earn, so that could mean they're overvalued relative to Bob's Burgers. So Bob's is comparably the better deal. PE ratios vary across all types of industries and companies, so you always need to compare within the same industry. In the case of Apple versus Google, Google trades at a 24 PE compared to Apple's 36.98, so there may be an argument that Google is undervalued relatively to Apple. However, there's much more to investing than just one stat, and I'm gonna make more videos on it, so make sure to follow me for more.

For stocks, the S&P 500 has averaged 10% per year since 1925 or the past 100 years or so. Real estate, however, has returned about 4.2% since 1928, according to the latest data from NYU Stern. With real estate, it's more common to use leverage to multiply returns, as well as there are depreciation strategies to increase your overall return as well. Lastly, crypto. Oh boy, Bitcoin has exploded 100,000% since 2010, but of course it comes with a ton of extreme volatility. It experienced a minus 84% drop from December 2017 to December 2018, which wiped out a lot of crypto investors. There are pros and cons to each of these, but which one are you choosing? Let me know in the comments.

It comes down to the idea that demand for gas is what's called inelastic. Gas is an item people buy that just doesn't have many substitutes. When prices of goods go up, the demand for it should decrease. But with inelastic demand, when the price of gas, say, goes up, the quantity demanded just decreases by a smaller percentage. Demand is relatively unresponsive to price changes in the case of gas because people need this item to drive, even if prices go up. Other goods that are like this could include eggs and milk. But what about goods that are elastic? In other words, they act the opposite. These are much more common and refer to anything that you buy much less of just because the price went up. So if price goes up, demand goes down a lot. Examples include luxury cars, designer clothing, airline tickets, or even concerts. Pricing is super fascinating when it comes to business and economics because if you price something incorrectly, your business could fail. But if the price is right, you could thrive.

But a common mistake people make is that they believe that their entire income is now taxed at 22%, leaving them to make less money, which is just not true. Here's how it actually works. In the first tax bracket, any amount of money you make up to $11,925 per year is taxed at 10%. Then the amount of money you make from 11,926 to 48,745 is taxed at 12%. You see, only dollars that you make in that corresponding bracket are taxed at that rate. In the case of the raise, you'll only pay 22% in taxes on any dollars above 48,476. So for a $50,000 salary, that means only 1524 of it is taxed at 22%. The rest of your salary is taxed at those lower rates, giving you an effective total rate of 12.1%. So making more money is always better. If you enjoy videos about finance and investing, follow me for more.

Number one is that investment income is taxed wildly differently than at your job. So if you make $100,000 in investment income, you'll get taxed at long-term capital gains rates or 15%, $15,000. That same $100,000 in a salary job, you're paying 22.4% in total tax. So what does that tell you? You should probably invest. Number two, any Roth retirement accounts. So these are accounts where all your profits that you make are tax-free and they're so overpowered that the government only lets you put in $7,000 per year if you're under the age of 50 or 8K per year over the age of 50. And number three, QBI deductions. America always encourages small businesses and small business owners and certain freelancers can get up to a 20% deduction on business profits. For example, if you make $190,000 in business income through an LLC, sole proprietorship, S Corp, or any entity with a pass-through income, your total tax owed is $29,522. If you made that at a job, you would owe $36,888 on federal income tax alone. So if you're able to understand how the system is set up and how it incentivizes different people to make money, you're going to be much better off. Follow me if you want a part two of this.

And this is typically the largest holding of any portfolio that I start and it's up 80% in the past five years. Next, I would add $200 of QQQ. That's the ETF giving you exposure to tech and software companies. It's done really well in the past five years, plus 128%. Then I would put $300 into individual stocks. So I would choose three stocks and put $100 into each of them. You want companies that will be around in 40 years. So think of your Apples, your Googles, or your JP Morgans of the world. It's important to not buy any penny stocks. My last $100 is staying in a high yield savings account in cash, waiting for opportunities. And I think this split provides a lot of diversification to stocks via ETFs, as well as you get some concentration into stable long-term companies.

Jetsuite X is the airline that lets you fly semi-privately and for this comparison I flew between LA and San Francisco and I started my timer when the airline announced boarding. For my United flight it took 54 minutes after they announced boarding for us to take off and after a 52 minute flight time I finally got out. All right just got out of the plane two hours and five minutes and about four seconds. Before I reveal how much time JSX saves let's look at the fare difference. For United I paid $135 for my flight to LA and Jetsuite X was $299 for one way. So is the time savings worth the cost? We're gonna break that down but first here's how long it took me. It took one hour and 37 minutes on Jetsuite X for the same segment thereby saving me about 28 minutes. Since the fare difference was $163 to save about a half hour if you value your time and around $330 per hour JSX becomes worth it on just the boarding 2D planning process. I'd also estimate you save about an hour each way because you have light security, you can arrive 20 minutes before your flight, and you don't have to navigate any terminals. Of course this is dependent on how early you get to the airport etc but I'm gonna leave up a breakdown of my times in particular and if you like this video make sure to follow me for more.

First, you wanna pick a brokerage you're comfortable with like Fidelity, Schwab, or M1 Finance and click open an account. Click on retirement and IRAs and then right here, you'll wanna choose open a Roth IRA. Then you need to fill out this. It's some basic information like your name, address, et cetera In your IRA dashboard, make sure to click contribute now. Once you connect your bank account, you can contribute to the Roth IRA. Now the contribution limit, I don't know if you can see this is $7,000 per year or $8,000 per year if you're over the age of 50. Personally, I would just automate it with a monthly recurring transaction of around 300 to $500 per month. Once you have some money in your Roth IRA, you wanna buy some index funds that will grow over time. So the S&P 500 has been growing 8% to 10% annually since it was started. Ticker symbols for that include VOO, SPY, FX, AIX, as well as VFIX. If you get average returns in the market for 40 years, your future balance is going to be $2.365 million. And the crazy part is is that you only contributed about $280,000, the rest is your return. Make sure to follow me for more finance videos like these on your page.

Created on 2025-02-04 17:45:24+00:00) This is how much I made in interest in my high yield savings account for the last three months. Now this includes my emergency fund as well as my savings for a down payment on a future house. So I personally keep about six months of expenses in an emergency fund. And for me, that looks like about $30,000 which I know sounds like a little bit on the high end but I like that peace of mind and it's about 5K a month. Then I have about 132K that I've been accumulating over the years as extra money for a down payment or investment property. I don't wanna invest these funds since I actually might need them soon. So therefore it just stays in my high yield account. In February, I made about $577. Now in January, I made $633.05. And in December, I made $630.15. The reason for the decrease recently is that the Federal Reserve lowered their interest rates a couple months ago. So my January interest was a tad lower. Still though, I get about a 4.5% return on my high yield savings through Wealthfront. And I love the fact that I got paid around $1,840 extra these past three months for literally doing nothing, just existing.

Created on 2025-02-03 15:37:35+00:00) President Trump officially imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, as well as 10% on Chinese goods over the weekend. The market today is reacting awfully because of it. As you can see, everything's in the red. Economists have predicted that tariffs will cause inflation and lower GDP growth, but why do tariffs cause inflation and should we be worried? If a toy costs $10 and Walmart imports it from say Canada, Walmart will now have to pay an extra $2.50 to US customs, thus probably passing on that cost likely to customers. A tariff then would incentivize the US based supplier like Walmart to seek out American made toys instead of Canadian ones. This will also hurt Canada and Mexico's economy way more than it hurts the United States, because currently nearly 80% of both Canada and Mexico's exports go to United States. On the US side, about 16% of US exports go to Canada and Mexico respectively. I think this is just a negotiation tactic by Trump because Canada and Mexico won't be able to sustain this for a long period of time. Both of their economies are more reliant on the US than the US is reliant on them. Now, will the real impact of these tariffs last? Well, I definitely could see GDP being affected as well as inflation. However, I do think that Trump knew all of these things going into it. If you're investing for the long term, such as your retirement, I don't think you need to do anything. Don't abandon your investing plans. However, if you are invested for the short term, such as the next few months, I don't think these tariff issues will be solved until at least the end of Q1. What do you think? Let me know in the comments.

Created on 2025-02-02 19:04:09+00:00) If you make $10,000 in profit on Apple stock, do you know how much tax you would have to pay? It depends entirely on how long you hold the stock as well as if you actually sold the stock. You'll owe taxes when you realize the profit, so that's when you actually sell the stock for a gain. So let's say you sell Apple stock and you realize a $10,000 gain in profit. If you held it for less than one year, you will owe short-term capital gains taxes, and that is taxed at your federal marginal tax rate. So if you make $120,000 per year, that puts you in the 24% marginal tax bracket, that means you will owe $2,400 in taxes on the gain of 10,000. If you're able to hold it for more than a year, your long-term capital gains rate then becomes 0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on your income. In this case, you would owe $1,500 in taxes if you sold it after owning it for more than one year. Now, keep in mind, if you just buy and hold and you don't sell at all, then you don't owe any taxes yet. It's only when you sell the stock.

Well, new, it's going to cost you $45,950, but you should never buy it new because after one year, the resale value is 21% less or $36,000. Cars are depreciating assets, which means that they lose value over time. If you Google car depreciation curve, you can see that all of them go downwards, but we can actually use this to save money. To get the most value, we wanna buy a car after the fourth year of depreciation. That's a used car sweet spot. In the case of the BMW, if you wait four years, that car's only gonna cost you $27,000 or about 51% less. I like to buy a car that's three to four years used, maybe has 15 to 20,000 miles on it, and is perhaps a lease turn back, and then I'm gonna buy it in cash. Follow me for more.

Number one is to start a budget and track how much you spend. Now, a good rule of thumb is to use the 50-30-20 rule. That's where 50% of your budget goes towards needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings. Second is to write down your net worth every quarter or every year to see if it's trending in the right direction. Personally, I tally all my bank accounts and investment accounts, and then I subtract any liabilities or debt that I have, and I try to track it on a regular basis. This habit increases your net worth because you're now paying attention to it, and I'll have a free net worth tracker for you guys down below. Number three is to invest your money and get it to work for you. I talk a lot about investing on this page, but by doing so, you're ensuring that your money isn't just sitting there losing value to inflation. If you're just getting started, putting money into index funds like the S&P 500 are a great way to start, so ticker symbols VOO or SPY. Let me know down below your net worth if you're comfortable in the comments.

Assuming you save 10K per year at a 7% return, it takes you 7.84 years to hit your first 100K, but the next 100K, since your money is working for you, would take you 5.1 years. Fast forward, and we can see that all subsequent 100K increments, each one is faster than the previous. You have money working for you and it's continuing to compound, and as you invest, it's like rolling a giant snowball down the hill. Look at the time between the 400K and 500K mark. You can see it's 2.5 years, and comparing that to the first 100K, it's a lot faster, but don't worry, it gets crazier still. By the time you're approaching the $1 million mark from the $900,000 mark, it's only going to take you 1.35 years for that same 100K. The first 100K takes you 25.5% of the total time it takes to get to a million dollars. The remaining 900K only takes 74.5% of the time, so that's pretty funny. It's like when you hit 100K, you're basically a quarter of the way to a million dollars. I know that sounds weird, but in terms of time, it's true.

It's the number one app in the top free apps. They released an AI model last week that basically rivals LLMs like ChadGBT, and it was created for a fraction of the cost. They claim around $6 million. Investors are worried because it was created without access to NVIDIA's most powerful chips, and NVIDIA's growth and share price relies on the AI industry actually needing those chips. Basically, current market and price levels are super reliant on future AI profits as well as the industry growing. DeepSeek is a huge threat to all that because if some startup from China can come in and do it for a very limited budget without the need for these chips, then the entire AI industry is now called into question. I do feel like the stock price of NVIDIA today seems like an overreaction, but valuations were high already, as you can see, and the S&P 500 is still overvalued compared to what it typically is. And some people on the internet don't believe that it only costs $6 million. Personally, I'm a little skeptical as well, but until we find out more, I'm not entirely sure that this is the end of the AI industry just yet.

There are three big reasons why that could happen. Now, the first is lifestyle inflation. So in this book, The Millionaire Next Door, the author found that people who often look well off are usually deeply in debt. Physicians and lawyers, for example, usually earn above average incomes, but they also tend to drive luxury cars and live in larger homes because they want to live in the same neighborhoods that their colleagues do. Common mistake number two is being burdened by too much debt. So if your friend has $5,000 in credit card debt for just one year, that's $5,000 they aren't investing. In that single year alone, that $5,000 could grow to over $50,000 in 30 years. Third, there's a lack of tracking or budgeting the money itself. So it's really easy to spend frivolously without knowing the full repercussions of how much you're spending versus how much you're not. If you track your money, you'll have a clear understanding of where your money is going and you won't be as likely to overspend. Do you know anyone that makes a good income yet they're broke? Let me know down below.

Created on 2025-01-26 00:02:09+00:00) You're gonna make your first 100K, it's not gonna come from investing, and that's something that people don't get. Pretend you get average gains in the market of 8% per year and start with $10,000, it would still take you 30 years to hit $100,000 just investing that sum, and nobody wants to wait that long. Charlie Munger, who was Warren Buffet's right-hand man, said it best, the first $100,000 is a bitch, but you gotta do it, I don't care what you have to do. So your first $100,000 actually comes mostly from saving every dollar and investing on top of that. If you save 12K a year for seven years at a 4.5% return, you will have $100,000, but look, 84% of it came from savings, and only 16% of it came from the interest in gains. A lot of the friction in building wealth is at the beginning of the journey, so every dollar when you're starting out saving matters that much more. I hope this helps.

So you gotta make sure you're protecting your money against inflation, and here are three options. Number one is just investing. The easiest way to beat the inflation rate is to invest in the market. So on average, the stock market returns about eight to 10% per year. And if you invest in index funds, you can buy the entire market just with one purchase. The second are treasury inflation protected securities, also known as TIPS. Now, these are government bonds that adjust their principal value with inflation. These aren't perfect by any means, but currently they provide around a 2.2% return above the inflation rate. Number three, you could consider real estate, which generally appreciates over time. Now, keep in mind that this isn't perfect either, but in general, property values and rental income tend to rise with inflation. As long as your money is working for you somehow, it's better than keeping it in a bank account that yields 0.01%. An easy option anybody can do is a high yield savings account for the time being while they pay about 4% per year.

First option are index funds and ETFs tracking the S&P 500. These are low to medium risk over a long-term time horizon and you'll set it and forget it. And it should on average return about 8 to 10% per year. Second, you could go with a three fund portfolio. That's where you have a US stock market index fund, an international stock market index fund and a bond fund. This is more diversified than the first option. So lower risk in general and is overall a solid choice. Third are individual stocks, especially mega caps. Since the Roth IRA gives you tax-free gains, you wanna take full advantage of that with holdings that have high upside. These are riskier, but having a few positions of companies of the caliber of Apple, Google, or Amazon could be good. $1,000 in Apple stock 20 years ago is worth more than $700,000 today. And if you invested in a Roth IRA, then all of those gains would be tax-free. That's the power of it.

In the 1980s, the DynaTAC was rolled out costing $3,995 and you'd get around 30 minutes of talk time and it's projected that those plans cost a few hundred dollars per month. Now in the 1990s, the Bureau of Labor Statistics cited cell services costing around $50 per month with limited talk time and some data usage. Now in the 2000s, the cost of cell phone services ranged but you could get your phone covered for about $30 per month. As more competitors entered the market, prices went down. However, by the 2010s, the introduction of smartphones and data plans meant that cell phone plans started to cost an average of $113 per month for one line with unlimited data, talk and text. But what if you could pay only $25 per month? Metro offers just that with their BYOD or bring your own phone plan. All you have to do is bring the phone you want to add the service to and pay $25 per month. You get unlimited 5G on one line with no contracts or credit checks.

This is going to be the foundation of your portfolio and it's up 83% in the past five years. Second, I'm adding another $3,000 into QQQ. That's the ETF that gives you exposure to the software and tech companies. And in the past five years, it's up 135%. Third, I'm going to add $2,000 into a high yield savings account.

Bitcoin is the guy that microdoses LSD for breakfast, he lives in an apartment that looks like this, and one day he's spending 5k at the club, but then the next day he's asking you for money. He talks about changing the system, but he can't even commit to dinner plans. Financial stocks are like artists full of potential, one year they can be flying you around the world because they're mega successful, but then society kind of weighs a little bit heavier on them, they're a little bit sensitive, so when people start to talk bad about them, they go into a dark, deep depression, and their stock price falls because of it too. Gold is the old money guy and talks about legacy, he's reliable in tough times, goes skiing in Aspen, and he's going to be happy when everyone else is miserable. And it's especially true when times are tough in the world.

**speculation: 60**","You will be presented with a series of questions related to a user of a Tiktok profile.
Each question is preceded by predefined responses with symbols (e.g. ""A1"", ""A2"" or ""B1"" etc.).
Please select, for each question, the most likely response based strictly on the provided profile data.

In your answer present, for each question, the selected symbol.
Write out in full the response associated with the selected symbol.
The chosen symbol / category must be the most likely to accurately represent this user.
You must only select one symbol / category per question.
A title, symbol and category cannot appear more than once in your answer.

For each selected symbol / category, please note the level of Speculation involved in this selection.
Present the Speculation level for each selection on a scale from 0 (not speculative at all, every single element of the user data was useful in the selection) to 100 (fully speculative, there is no information related to this title in the user data).
Speculation levels should be a direct measure of the amount of useful information available in the user's profile.
Speculation levels pertain only to the information available in the user data -- namely the username, name, description, location, profile picture and videos from this user -- and should not be affected by additional information available to you from any other source.
To ensure consistency, use the following guidelines to determine speculation levels:

0-20 (Low speculation): The user data provides clear and direct information relevant to the title. (e.g., explicit mention in the profile or videos)
21-40 (Moderate-low speculation): The user data provides indirect but strong indicators relevant to the title. (e.g., context from multiple sources within the profile or videos)
41-60 (Moderate speculation): The user data provides some hints or partial information relevant to the title. (e.g., inferred from user interests or indirect references)
61-80 (Moderate-high speculation): The user data provides limited and weak indicators relevant to the title. (e.g., very subtle hints or minimal context)
81-100 (High speculation): The user data provides no or almost no information relevant to the title. (e.g., assumptions based on very general information)

For each selected category, please explain at length what features of the data contributed to your choice and your speculation level.

Preserve a strictly structured answer to ease parsing of the text.
Format your output as follows for a categorical question (this is just an example, I do not care about this specific title or symbol / category):
**question: What is the age of the user in this profile?**

The 401k itself is not an investment. It is how the investment is treated under section 401k or section 401 subsection K of the IRS code, meaning that you're allowed to have money taken out of your check and put into an investment pre-tax and then it grows tax free if it's a Roth 401k tax deferred if it's a regular 401k. Now, what's been underperforming is not the actual 401k. It's more like the coat that is keeping the investment warm. It's the investment inside the coat that sucked. If you had an underperforming 401k, what you really had was an underperforming investment in your 401k. Does that make sense? Sort of, and what do you mean by that? Okay, pretend like there's a cookie jar and that's the investment with the cookies. The cookies in the cookie jar are either good or bad. The jar doesn't determine that. The jar is just where you park the cookies. That make sense? Yes. You could have peanut butter cookies, you could have sugar cookies, you could have chocolate chip cookies and they could be good cookies or they could suck, but the jar didn't cause any of that to happen. The jar's just where you have them. The 401k is the jar, the investment is the cookies. So we basically, at the three places I've worked at, they didn't really have the right investment. Or you didn't pick the right ones from the ones that they offered. Right, there was four on each one of them. No, there was four general portfolios on each one of them and you picked the wrong portfolio, but you probably could have gone even inside of those four portfolios, meaning they had a low risk, a medium risk, and a high risk or something like that. And that high risk would have had a group of mutual funds in it that would have sounded a lot like what we tell you to do and you would have done a lot better had you been in that versus the one you were in. And so what you're looking for is you're looking for mutual funds inside the 401k, whether there's a match or not. A match is helpful, obviously, because it's freaking free money. But you're looking for mutual funds inside the 401k that have a good long-term track record. And I personally, in my 401k here at my business, do this and I recommend that other people do the same thing, that you put it in four types of mutual funds. Growth, growth and income, aggressive growth, and international. And that's the cookies, okay? You summon a chocolate chip cookie, you want some peanut butter cookie, you want some sugar cookie and so on, right? Some Oreos or whatever, I'm just making this up as I go here. But the bottom line is that you're trying to get different kinds of investments that have good long-term track records and they fall under the heading of growth stock mutual funds inside the 401k. You can also do that inside a Roth. And if you don't like the options that your company has available to you to invest inside the 401k and there's no match, then you could go to just a Roth IRA, do the exact same thing and pick from any of 8,000 mutual funds. So certainly you could get a good one that way.

Whatever happened in the past, yeah, we'll glance back there and make sure we don't do it again and run over somebody else. But right here, this is all options in front of us, right? Listen, mistakes don't define you, they refine you. You screwed up this morning, so what? Start again, right now. Take another step. If you keep taking a step, you can get anywhere, guys. The trick is just don't quit, right?

Created on 2025-02-13 20:27:24+00:00) are newlyweds. We've been married for six months and now we are looking at combining our finances, but he is a little bit nervous. Together we have a total of $137,000 in student loans, where mine is over $111,000 and his is a lot less. Did he know this when you got married? Yes sir, he did. Did he say the vows at the altar that said for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, unto thee all my worldly goods I pledge? Yes sir, he did. Did he mean it? I hope so. Then why are your finances not combined? Because he's nervous about my family and how I handle my finances with them. You give your family money without talking to your husband? Well, before we got married I used to live with my parents, so I pay for half of the mortgage and I pay for other bills. Still? And still, yes. After you got married, you pay half the mortgage for somebody else when you have $111,000 in student loan debt? Yes sir. Why? Because my parents are in their 80s and they don't work. Do they not have Social Security? We're not from this country, so no sir. Okay. Did your husband know that you were obligated to take care of your 80 year old parents when you got married? He did, but he also would like some help from my siblings and that's one part where I'm nervous to talk to my siblings about it. I'm not. It's overdue. I agree with your husband. He would like to combine our finances, but because of the situation that I'm in, he doesn't know how to go about doing that. Yeah. Well, the way he would go about it is is that the two of you come into agreement on what you are willing to do to support your parents. When you lived there, it was perfectly logical that you took care of half the mortgage because you were a roommate with them. Now that you don't live there anymore and you have your own household, it now becomes a charitable act to aging parents that you take care of the mortgage, which should be shared with siblings. I agree with him. Yes sir. Yesterday, like before you got married, this should have been talked about to your siblings. I'm moving out and we're all taking care of mom and dad split-seas. Yes sir. That's where I have to start doing that. Yeah, and I think you know you agree to do that. So you think your siblings aren't going to want to take care of your parents? I'm sure that they would if they could, but all of them. I don't come from a financially stable household. We were never taught how to save or do any of that. So everyone is working paycheck to paycheck. Gotcha. And how much does it take to support your mom and dad? It would be about $2,000 U.S. Are they in the U.S.? Yes. Okay, per month. My siblings, most of them are not. Okay, $2,000 U.S. per month. Yes, that's covering... And what is your household income, you and your new husband? Our household income after tax is $80,976. Okay, so you're making about $102,000, $103,000 right? Yes sir. Okay, well that's pretty good news. And your siblings, how many of them are there? I have seven in total. Okay, well here's what it sounds like if I'm at your house. You guys have to talk this through, okay? We can't put your parents in the street. No. That is not an option. No. Okay, what do your parents have? Any income or any assets? Not in the U.S. Okay, what income and assets do they have outside the U.S.? If they went back home, they have their own property and they don't have much expenses there. Right, and so where is home? Belize, Central America. Okay, and what is that property worth were they to sell it? Probably about $60,000 U.S. And that would take care of about 30 months? Yes, but I have one brother living there, so we can't sell that one. Oh, we can sell it. He can move and rent. It's not his property. This is so... I mean, listen, I understand taking care of your parents and I want you to be doing that. I don't want to put old people in the street. That is not my heart, but I agree with your husband that there's a toxic thing going on here and the only one that's getting ridden is you. Yeah. Nobody else is doing what they're supposed to do in this whole story. Your parents aren't selling their property. Your brothers and sisters aren't chipping in what they can chip in. Now, if I were your husband, I would say, listen, I am fine helping to support them as long as everybody puts in something. Not necessarily equal, because I understand they're in a different country. They don't necessarily have the income, but everybody puts in something. I don't care if it's $50. Everybody puts in something, and the property back home is being sold. Yes, sir. Let's pretend you were broke. What would they do? We don't have to pretend. No, I mean, that's true, because you got $111,000 in student loan debt, but I'm saying, let's pretend you didn't have any options here to participate. What would happen to mom and dad? They would sell the property back home to keep from being in the street, or they'd move back home and live in that property. One of the two, wouldn't they? Yes. Ta-da. Okay, and once we combine our finances and get that out, what would be your best advice for us to tackle this huge loan that we have? Head on as fast as you can, living on nothing. It's going to be somewhat slowed by the money you use to help take care of your parents, and I suggest to your husband that he agree to something where you do participate in taking care of your parents if the property is sold and the other siblings participate at some level, but if they're all going to leave it all on you, I'm going to leave it all on them and let them figure it out, because I think they're being stubborn and milking you like you're a cow. I think everybody's got a place to play here, and nobody's playing but you. So if I'm your husband, I would have to be willing to take care of your mom and dad, but not when no one else is participating.

Because if you look around, 70% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. You want to be that? I don't want to be that. When I hit bottom, I mean, I didn't hit bottom, I completely splatted. I know what stupid looks like. I looked that boy in the mirror. I know who he is. And so you don't want to live like that. But your foundational stuff is to at least get rid of your debt, not counting your home. And at least get you a rainy day fund. You have to look in the mirror and look at each other as a married couple or as a single. Look in the mirror and say, no, we're not going on vacation. We're broke. We have two car payments and a credit card loan, credit card debt and a student loan that's been around so long we think it's a pet. No, we're not going to strut around acting like we're something we're not. It's time to lay these basic steps out and lay into them and say, that's it. I'm tired of being broke. I worked too stinking hard to be this broke.

Two is pay off all your debts except your home using the debt snowball where you list your debts, smallest to largest, and pay them off in that order with great focused intensity. Once you're out of debt, then you go back to the $1,000 account in baby step three and raise it up to a fully funded emergency fund of three to six months of expenses. You need to run like your hair's on fire until you get those three steps done. You need to be in a panic until you get those three steps done. Just think about your life right now. How would that feel? No payments, but a house payment and 15 or 20,000 or $10,000 laying there. You're not even there yet and you just started breathing better. Just thinking about it. But until you get there, you're just scrapping and clawing like a rat in a wheel, man. And so you have to break the cycle. You've got to get so fired up and wired up that your broke friends think you've lost your mind.

Created on 2025-02-11 21:22:13+00:00) I was studying at West Point, and when I went abroad my senior year, I acted a fool and got myself kicked out right before I graduated, so now I owe the government about $300,000. And while I was there, I also took out a personal loan of about $35,000. I recently got married in May, and my wife, she can't work right now because we're waiting on her green card. I bounced around a few jobs since then, and the one I'm working on now is on a bad job, but I'm not particularly passionate about it. And I'm actually on my way now to do my orientation for Domino's. I'm going to go deliver pizzas as a side job, but I don't really know what to do. I had my career path to be in the Army, and I thought I was going to figure it out then, but right now I'm just, I don't know, I feel like I'm working, and to pay off all those debts is going to take me a long time, I feel like. Yeah, how old are you? 24. So you are how close to graduating from West Point? The day before, they told me I was getting separated. Oh man, I'm so sorry. What a disaster. Yeah, well, I mean, I'm the one that misbehaved, but I take responsibility for that. I understand. It's a tough situation. Yeah, you did it, but what a mess. The, so I am not positive, I mean, obviously that is the preeminent military war college. Do those college credits transfer to another college? Yes, yes, I actually transferred them and was able to get my degree last month. Okay, that's good news. In what? I got one of those stupid majors you talk about, because I plan on being in the Army, but it's in Russian studies. Okay, but that was the closest thing for you to finish. Yes, sir, I ended up finishing up with the same degree I was studying at West Point. Right, okay, but at least you come out with a degree. Okay. All right. Oh my goodness. Well, I think, you know, what I'm going to do, what drew you to Russian studies while you're in the military? What was your, obviously you were studying it from a military aspect, is that right? Right, and I just fell in love with the language. I was originally a math and econ major, but I wanted to go abroad and learn the language and then hopefully get a job in the government agency after. Yeah, okay, here's what I want you to do. I want you to pursue international business with a specialization in Russia, and I want you to learn how to do trade and how to do deals, because you've got these skills. You've got a natural tendency to business with econ and math. You've got the skill set to do that, and you've got this very specialized set of skills, understanding the Russian culture, language, and so forth, agreed? Yes, sir. Yeah, I think that translates to international business, and there is a lot of money flowing in and out of Russia, legal money, not illegal money, as you probably already know, and so, I would lean into that and say that's going to be the salvation of this mess, because you've got a really, really big hole here, and delivering Domino's pizza is not going to get you out of 300 grand. Well, that's my side job. Okay, and your day job is what? I work in a rubber factory. Okay, now making what? I make about $15 an hour, so it's about 30 grand a year. Okay, well, I want you to forgive yourself for your stupidity and reset your career, and go, okay, I'm 24, I did a really dumb thing, it's now in the rearview mirror, I'm not a $15 an hour guy, I'm a $100,000 a year guy, and I'm going to go about becoming a specialist in Russian international business, and I'm going to find a job, and I'm going to find people that work with people in Russia, businesses that interact with that, and I'm going to go work for them, and I'm going to make some serious money to get out of this mess. Even if you didn't have this mess, that would be what you would need to do, because you've got that potential, and I don't want you to take a $15 an hour job, and that is now your future in a factory, because you had, right on the cusp of graduating from one of the world's finest institutions, you did something stupid. That does not need to define your life. It just needs to cause your life to be redirected. Is that okay? Yeah, I think my biggest thing is just not really, you know, my purpose was to serve in the Army, and now, since then, I've just kind of been wandering about. Yep, and it's time to get a new one, brother. Not having a purpose sucks, doesn't it? I'm sitting here trying to give you a new one, because, listen, other than the dumb thing you did, you don't get to the final cut, the final day at West Point, if you're stupid. You're not an ignorant, you're not an unintelligent person, okay? You don't get there. It's not possible. It's too tough. Am I wrong? You're right. Okay, you did a dumb thing. That doesn't make you unintelligent, it makes you a smart guy who did a dumb thing. I can, you put my name on that list, I'm a smart guy who's done a lot of dumb things in my life. So, put it in the rearview mirror, and let's reset our purpose. We're not going that way. Okay, where are we going? There's got to be a different adventure, and it doesn't mean that you are doomed to a life of slavery. Next time I talk to you, I want a little more hope in your voice, a little more energy in your voice, and I want you fired up and wired up about where you're going, because that's the next step in your life, brother, and you're not getting out of this debt with Domino's Pizza and $15. Besides that, it'd be a waste of your life. You're too sharp. There's too much good you can still do, and you can have some fun with the skill set you've got, and you may even be able to get involved in policy and some other stuff in the government position. You don't have to graduate from West Point to use your skill set in a think tank in D.C. somewhere. So, don't camp on the backside of the desert here too long, my brother. You've got stuff to do.

Created on 2025-02-11 17:03:12+00:00) God want me or us to be wealthy? Here's the true idea, okay? God doesn't care if you're wealthy or if you're poor. He doesn't care, one way or the other. All He wants is your heart. All He wants is your worship. And if poverty gets in the way of your worship, that's a problem. If wealth gets in the way of your worship, that's a problem. Those of us that are people of faith, that are people of the book, believe that we don't own anything. We are merely managing it for God. There's all this biblical evidence that we're not supposed to worship wealth and that wealth can be dangerous because it can become an idol. But if we can maintain the distance from it as a manager instead of an owner, if you don't say my my my my my, instead you go, I'm holding this with an open hand, what do you want me to do with it? It's yours. And then you're managing it. If you're faithful with the little things, you'll be given more to manage. But on the other hand, you're not better than someone else. I know some of the highest character, smartest people who are not wealthy. And that does, you know, you're not better than them if you're managing more money than they're managing. You just have more responsibility.

Created on 2025-02-10 15:05:47+00:00) If you agreed on four things prior to marriage, you have a very high statistical probability of staying married. Money. How we handle it. How we view it. Kids. Are we going to have them? How many? How are we going to treat them? The crazy people in our family called in-laws. Everybody's got it. So how are we going to handle that? How are we going to handle the extended crazy and are we going to stand beside each other in that? And it's religion. Agreement on religion. And so if you're in agreement on those four things, you have a very high probability.

Created on 2025-02-08 19:27:45+00:00) You want to win with money? Let me give you a good idea. Figure out what most people are doing and run in the other direction. Run in the other direction. Most people are broke. Most people look good and they're broke. They spend more than they have coming in. They don't act their wage. They don't live on a plan. They don't agree on spending with their spouse. Their only hope for retirement is that the government, which is well known for its ability to handle money, will take care of them. They don't have money set aside for emergencies. They run credit card debt and student loans and card debt all day, every day. They spend like they're in Congress. Most people are stupid when it comes to money. 70% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. The bankruptcy rate is at an all time high and foreclosures are rising again. Credit card debt continues to climb and we have a trillion dollars in student loan debt out there. The average car payment in America today now is $496 over 84 months. That's stupid. Normal in America is broke and stupid. You don't want to be normal. You want to be weird. One of the greatest compliments you can get on this show is if you call up and I say, man, you're weird. I'm looking at weird people. You guys are weird, which means that you're contrary. You are a contrarian. You are perpendicular to the culture. When the culture has lost its way, the best thing you can do is be opposite. Figure out whatever they're doing and do the other thing, right? Because you're not going to get, you're only going to get what they're getting when you do what they're doing. This is not hard to figure out. If you keep doing what you've been doing, you're going to keep getting what you've been getting. You do reap what you sow. You live in a cause a cause and effect world, baby. There's no way around this. So your goal, when I went broke, I realized my goal is to be weird. My goal is to be different. And personal finance is 80% behavior. It's only 20% head knowledge. So this is not some math formula that you've got a problem with. This is a person in your mirror. I figured out if I can make the guy in my mirror behave, he can be skinny and rich. He's got issues. And once we realize that behavior is what causes people to handle their money poorly or handle it well, then what we've got to decide is our behavior. And if you have the same behaviors as broke people have in, when it comes to money, you're going to have the same, you're going to have the same results. Broke people have, you're just going to be another broke person. And some of you are making $250,000 a year and you're broke. You had no money at all. You got a mess loans coming out your ears. You can't breathe. You run, run, run, run, run, run, run. Run, run, run, run. Like a rat in a wheel, have a heart attack and die and wonder what happened. This is no way to live. Buying things you can't afford with money. You don't have to impress people. You don't really like some of you spend an unbelievable amount of money on a car payment to impress somebody at a stoplight. You will never be introduced to the buddy. You felt cool there for about what? Three and a half seconds. Fool. I've been that fool. That's why I know who he is. I've been that guy. I've been that shallow where I thought that my car actually mattered to somebody. Give me a break. Nobody gives a rip about your car. It, listen, if, if you know what I drive right now, anything I want, you know why? Cause I drove crap for a long time. I drove cars like nobody else would drive. Now I get to drive whatever I want to drive. And I don't drive them for you. I drive them because I like them. I couldn't give a careless what you think about what I drive. It's not my problem. It's not your problem either. By the way, I'm going to enjoy, I'm a boy. I like nice cars. I'm going to get, but I'm not going to have a nice car with a stupid car payment on it. It's ridiculous. If your self-esteem is so screwed up that you're doing that, then you're going to struggle with money. You're normal. People spending a bunch of money to act like there's something they're not what they call in Texas, big hat, no cattle. You need to decide. I don't care what other people think. And I'm going to be weird, whatever you're doing with money. I'm going to do the opposite thing. And when you decide that you'll start winning with money. I don't have any credit cards, not a single one. No, I don't believe in points. I've never met a millionaire. So Dave, you know, I made all my money with my airline miles. No stupid people. Don't say that in the real world. I meet middle-class people who spend everything on a credit card because they're racking up points. Not figure this math out for me. You get 1% back on your stupid discover card, right? Have you ever discovered what the math is on that discover card? That means if you spend $100,000, you get $1,000. Is this a path to wealth anywhere? You went to math class. That's just straight up stupid. I mean, in the sixth grade, you should have been able to figure the fourth grade. Third grade. You should have been able to figure that one out that that's not going to work. I mean, you run a hundred grand through a stupid credit card to get a free airline ticket. Give me a break. With what you overspent, you could have bought 10 airline tickets and all in the name of I'm racking up points. I'm beating. You're not beating anybody. They're a multibillion dollar company. They've got done so many behavior studies on you based on your zip code and your demographic. They know what kind of bottled water you drink, fool. They're tracking you. Every movement you make on the web is being followed with web analytics. They know exactly what you're doing. No, this is not a conspiracy theory. They are better at marketing than you are at living your life. And they're selling you so much crap. You're broke. And you're playing their game. You're playing Citibank's game. What's in your wallet? I'll tell you what's in my wallet. Money. That's what's in my wallet. It's not a bunch of stupid plastic. So I'm weird. Dave, you're weird. You're right. I'm not broke. Normal's broke. I don't want to be normal. I engage in weird activities. And so I get weird results. And that's called money. I'm not broke anymore because I do things that broke people don't do. And I don't do things that the broke people do do. Why is this hard? You want to be skinny? Find out what skinny people eat. Eat what they eat. You'll be skinny. You want to be fat? Eat what fat people eat. You will be fat. This is not rocket science, people. Figure it out. You want a great marriage? Well, don't ask somebody who's been divorced six times. We'll pray for them. But I don't need their marriage advice. They ain't got this thing figured out, baby. I want to find somebody that's winning and emulate them. This is not rocket science. Be weird. That's your goal, darling. Be weird. Weird, weird, weird, weird.

Right, because if you have 20 people, well, that's exactly... You distribute the problem of your own sanity. I thought that was marriage. That's right. Well, that's what marriage... Marriage... In a huge part, the advantage of marriage is that, is that, you know, your wife taps you back into position and vice versa. If you're going to be sane, you have to be acceptable to, valued by, and in constant contact with a social group. And then you need to, if you're wise, select your social group carefully. I mean, this is why there were businessmen organizations like the Rotary and the Kinsmen and so forth. And, you know, we see their membership plummeting in recent years. But it was there because people were wise enough to understand that even if you had attained things, you know, on your own as a solitary venture, an entrepreneur, that it was extremely useful to have a community around you. It's not good that men be alone. No, no, no. You, you...

I feel like I really want to spend time raising our little one. Cool. What a great goal. So does he make enough money for you to live on? Yeah, like he makes about $975,000. What's that mean? $975,000. $975,000 a year? Yeah. Okay, I think you could probably freaking struggle through. It's not so much the finances as it is, I think he has a worry that I'll never go back to work. So? Like, I don't know. I think because his mom works like three jobs. So? I know. He makes $975,000. Okay, here's the deal. Sharon Ramsey went home to be a full-time mom when our first daughter was born 34 years ago. Yeah. She has never worked in the workplace since. She is engaged in a lot of ministry boards. She sits on hospital boards. She is engaged in being a full-time Mimi to six grandbabies. She raised three wonderful children. I call that an incredible career. I do too. Okay. I just don't know how to get my husband on the same page. Why does he go do all of that if it's not so that your family can do what they want to do? I know. Like, I just don't see the point in paying like a nanny or daycare. So if you want to be outside the home and have a career and that's your aspiration and you want to do that, then no shame on that either. Absolutely. But but this idea that somehow motherhood is full-time motherhood is not a is somehow to be shamed or to be looked down upon is absolute BS. Moms can't win because if they work they're guilty and if they don't work they're guilty. Mm-hmm. I know. It's like guilt is built into the whole program or something. I don't know what it is. What's a boy child do for a living? We've been together about seven. She's an investment advisor. I guess he is. I'm the writer. Okay. It's so impressive. He's doing so well. I don't know. I think that number one, I just want to give you encouragement and say, A, this is not crazy. It's not irresponsible. As a matter of fact, it is a high dignity position. I mean, this is a high calling and it has dignity, it has value, it has worth equivalent to anything you could do in the workplace. No shame, no guilt, and should be no hesitation financially or economically.

Created on 2025-02-05 16:59:08+00:00) I personally invest in good growth stock mutual funds. I spread it across four types, growth and income, growth, aggressive growth, and international. And I buy mutual funds that have at least a 10-year track record. Let's talk about those for a second because there's all kinds of names for mutual funds. And the name of the mutual fund tells you what is in the fund, OK? A growth and income fund is also called a large cap fund, or sometimes also called a blue chip fund. Now, the blue chip is the most expensive chip on the poker table. So that means these are big companies in this. Large cap is short for large capitalization. Large capitalization means these are large companies. And so your growth and income funds are large companies, boring. Of the four types of mutual funds that I put money into, and I recommend, this is the calmest. If you were to chart this volatility on this fund versus the stock market, you would see it's a lot calmer than the market. And so it's your friend when things are going down, in other words. It's your stable. It's the big old dinosaur companies. They're boring. When things are going up, by the way, it's also boring. It's not exciting when things are going up. It's a downer. You look at that thing going, why is it not doing well when the rest of the market's going up? Because it goes slower than the market up and slower than the market down, because it's a stable land. Stable land. A growth fund is right in the middle. The S&P 500 index fund would be considered a growth fund. A growth fund is companies that are growing. They're kind of medium-sized companies. So you might hear it called mid-cap fund. And so these are just standard growth stock mutual funds. There's a whole lot of these out there. Ton of funds that fall in this area. So the idea is pretty simple. The growth fund, that's kind of right there in the middle. You want something in the middle. It's pretty much going to do about what the market does in terms of volatility, but you can get mutual funds that are growth stock mutual funds that outperform the S&P 500. You can even get growth and income funds, even though they're not as volatile, that outperform the S&P 500. Then there's the aggressive growth fund. This is the wild brother, okay? It's the crazy one. And so you might guess it's going to be also called a small-cap funds. These are the small companies, the startups. A lot of tech companies would fall into there. Very crazy. All the fun, weird stuff is in there. And that means some of it fails and goes to zero. And so it's a crazier mix. It's going to be much more volatile than the stock market is. So it's going to go up faster than the market goes up, but it's going to go down faster than the market goes down. Small-cap aggressive growth stock mutual funds. Also known in there as, let's see, small-cap aggressive growth. Oh, emerging market. You would call it that too as well. International funds means that the stocks in it are our overseas companies. They're not American companies. It has a kissing cousin called a global fund. If you think of a globe, what is it? It's everything. So that would have international and US companies in a global fund. And it would be a cousin to an international. By the way, American companies generally outperform other international companies by and large as a group. And so your international fund will be your worst performing of the four over the last several decades. And a global fund will outperform an international fund because you put some spice in there. You put some American companies in there usually. And so they're a little bit better, but at least you got some stuff overseas. You're not 100% betting on the American economy. Not that I'm anti-American. I am not. This is not a patriotic thing. This is a diversification thing. And so you want to have some BMW and some Mercedes in there. You want to have some LG and some other stuff. Even though some of those things are made stateside, those are foreign companies. And so you look for companies that are overseas based, could be a French company, could be whatever, and that are in an international fund. And then you spread your investing across those four types. You know, very simple here. Very simple. The thing is, do it. That's the thing. Everybody talks and talks and talks and talks and talks about investing. The problem is nobody does it. The people we talked to on the Millionaire Theme Hour that are millionaires, you know how they got to be millionaires? They did it.

Because your most powerful wealth-building tool is your income. And when you haven't committed your income in the form of payments to everybody else, you can invest it and become wealthy. Really. The average car payment in America today is $503. That's just cray-cray. That's nutty. If you invest $500 in a decent growth stock mutual fund from age 30 to age 70, you'll have over $5 million. That one thing will make you worth $5 million. Getting out of the land to car payments, just staying out of them. Isn't that amazing? And so I've become known for getting people out of debt, and the only reason I get people out of debt is because it increases their generosity and increases their ability to invest and become wealthy, which also increases their generosity. And it changes your life. It changes your family tree. It changes your retirement. You retire with dignity. You don't have to buy that cookbook, 72 Ways to Prepare Alpo, and love it. You can retire with dignity. But you have to do it on purpose. And getting out of debt in order to invest is the shortest way.

I'm just really torn because I love my home and I love my neighborhood, but I just want to be able to pay my debt off and provide better for my son. Okay. Uh, so you own the home with your boyfriend or? No, sir. It's just me. You own it. Yeah. Okay. Um, when is he leaving? Uh, that's a great question. Well, I'll give you the answer tonight. I can hear it. No, no. I can hear it in your voice. You sound really afraid to me. Yeah. Well, I'm trying to talk to you outside and he's actually standing next to me cause she can't go inside. Okay. Um, I have about $16,000 worth of debt. Um, and it includes a car credit card, the medical debt from the birth of our son that I get no help with. Yeah. Um, my home, your ELT said that I could potentially walk away with about 88,000 so I could reasonably pay all that off. I could set my son up and myself up in a nice town home or a reasonable town home in a nice area. Good schools. What is your income? Uh, I just got a promotion at my job. I've been there about 10 years. Um, I don't quite know what it works out to me, but it's $21 an hour. I believe it's like 44. Okay. How old are you? I'll be 32 this month, sir. How old's your baby? Eight months. Okay. Okay. Um, I don't know if you need to sell your house or not. You may, that's possible, but that's not your problem today, is it? Yeah. Okay. Do you have family in the area? I do. Um, my mom passed away about two years ago, unfortunately. So, um, I still have my dad and brothers. Oh, you have a father and brothers in the area. Yes. And my grandma, my aunt who would have room for me and Charlie, my son. Okay. Um, you need to get in the car and go to your dad's house when you hang up the phone. I can't do that, sir. I've tried that already. Why can't you do that? Do I need to call the police for you? No, sir. We've already gone through that. Oh, well, I'm about to go through it again. Where are you, Danielle? Are you outside your house right now? Yes, ma'am. Okay. Do you have car keys? Where's Charlie? Where's your, where's your son? In his father's house. In front of my car. All right. You need to, uh, when you hang up, you need to call the police. You need to call your father and you need to get you and your son away from this guy. Do you hear me? Do you understand this is not going to work otherwise, honey. This is not a house problem and it's not a debt problem. You and your son are in danger. Do you understand me? Hello? Yes, sir. Can you hear me? I'm sorry. Where'd you go? Sir, can you hear me? Yeah, I can. Where are you? Okay. I'm sorry. I'm not here. Did you hear what I said or were you distracted? Yes, I did, sir. No, I heard you. Okay. So are you going to sit there in the middle of the sewage or are you going to fix it? I want to fix it. That's why I want this on my home. And I just want to be done. Honey, we don't need to call a realtor. We need to get the boyfriend out of the house and that's going to involve the police and or your father and your brothers. He needs to leave. It's your house. And you're afraid. You understand that this is wrong, right? Yes, sir. Okay. This is, this is, you're, you're not the crazy one. I'm talking to the sane one. No, I'm always trying to do things like that. Yeah, I know. All right. I'll tell you what we're going to do. We're gonna put you on hold and Kelly is going to make sure that law enforcement gets over there. Okay. No, baby doll. I'm not going to be, I'm not, I love you and that baby. Do what? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's okay. It's okay, honey. You're, you're in a, listen, listen, easy, breathe. You're in a horrible situation and you have to make the moves to get away from it. Okay. And part of, part of the type of situation that you are in is that his part of his psychological job is he has convinced you that you're not able to operate without him. And I'm convinced the only way you're ever going to be able to operate is without him. You understand me? Yes, sir. Okay. Listen, you are worth being okay. It's worth being okay for your kid. It's worth being okay. It's your freaking house. He's trespassing. We're going to remove the trespasser. It has to happen. Okay. You have to get away from this guy. Anyone who calls a national radio show and is in this kind of distress tells me that there's serious stuff going on inside your walls. You understand? And then once he's clear, we're going to put you with one of our counselors free. I'm not going to charge you a dime and we're going to walk with you. And then we can start making decisions about your finances. But you don't have a financial problem. You need a boyfriend ectomy and it's happening today, darling. It's happening today. Do you understand? Yes, sir. Today. And Danielle, if you feel like you need you and your son need to be somewhere safe, then I would get out of the house as well. Removing him may not. We're not, you know, after he's gone, you can make this determination with local law enforcement, but you don't get a restraining order. You can do whatever you need to do at that point. But you and the baby need to get out of there until he's gone. And then you need to get someone to remove him. And it's that simple. So, um, that's what you have to do. And then you can begin to have a conversation, uh, in some form of sanity because the situation you are in right now is insane. It's an insane situation. You're not insane, but the situation's crazy girl. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Hey, we love you. You hold on a second. Kelly's going to pick up. Okay. And we're going to make sure you get taken care of.

I live a pretty humble lifestyle but what am I doing wrong? You said people your age. What is your age? I'm 33. Okay, you're single? Yes. Okay, what do you make? I make $60,000 before taxes. Good for you. What do you do? I'm a health educator. Cool. Do you have a lot of debt? I actually have no debt except for my mortgage which I only owe $140,000. This is the problem. The millennial, your generation, was the one of the first ones to really really struggle with it. It used to be that we would say don't keep up with the Joneses. Have you ever heard that old saying? Of course. Yeah, but the problem was in those days it wasn't as hard to keep up with the Joneses because they lived next door and you saw them drive in their car but you also saw them have big fight and you also knew that their kids were messed up and you knew this and you knew that so you know when they got a car it wasn't as big a deal because you kind of knew some of the dirt too, right? But on social media your only thing you're looking at is the highlight reel because nobody posts on there how my husband just got me a 1992 Honda. Hashtag blessed. We all can fall prey to this because we're not seeing reality.

A new car loses 60% of its value in the first five years. If you buy a $40,000 car, when you drive it off the lot and you hear that sound going over the curb, boom, boom, when you went into the street, that sound was $10,000. As soon as it's titled to an individual and it touches the street, it's gonna drop 20, 25% that day. That means your $40,000 car in five years is gonna be a $16,000 car.

Created on 2025-01-28 21:29:25+00:00) what's the best way for me to get wealthy? Like, I don't want to say rich, but like wealthy is like the best way. Yeah, it's a big question. It's probably too big for a radio answer. I'll tell you the biggest thing, a couple things. Number one is to be doing what you're doing now, gather knowledge, be very intentional with your money. Most people just kind of wander along and then wonder what happened. And if you'll just be very intentional, then that will lead you to doing a budget. That will lead you to living on less than you make. That will lead you to generosity. That will lead you to avoiding debt. That will lead you to investing. And those are the keys to building wealth. But no one does that accidentally. No one wins the Super Bowl on accident. It's an intentional act. And so just by asking the question, you've started that process of being intentional. So Dave, there's a lot of media sensations that pop up with a couple of college friends come up with an idea and they have an IPO and they turn into overnight this is and that's. Has it been your experience though that the vast majority of people who build, and I love that he already knows the distinction here, that build wealth, it takes a long time, doesn't it? Yeah, get rich quick just does not work, statistically. It's so rare. And the interesting thing is those that do it, very seldom keep it. And so because they didn't build the infrastructure in their character to carry it. And it fritters away. You build the muscles by increment, by struggle after struggle after struggle because a muscle is built by tearing. A muscle is built by destruction, by pain. It is not built by comfort. And so that gradual over a 10, 12, 15 year period of staying out of debt, living on less than you make, being intentional, doing some things that your friends don't do, not doing a bunch of things your friends do do, and that kind of a thing. You have a life, but you're just very smart and wise about it over a period of time. That is how wealth is built. I talked to a young man this morning, 35 years old, came up to me and whispered, he said, I'm an everyday millionaire. And works on our team. Really? Yeah. Walked up to me after a staff meeting, he said, I'm an everyday millionaire, 35. I said, how old are you? He said, 35. I mean, he said, I started working your plan 12 years ago, just out of college. He said, we've always lived exactly what we teach here, to the dime, to the penny, intentional. And he makes good money, but he doesn't, he didn't get paid a million dollars a year, I'll tell you that. He didn't make millionaire money, right? He didn't make millionaire money, but he is. Right. Because he's just that steady, the tortoise wins the race, not the hare. Every time. Yeah. And that's the, you know, all the data we have on millionaires tells us that's how they do it.

Created on 2025-01-28 15:48:29+00:00) people get married what do they do with their finances? How do they just suddenly combine everything? Yes. They do? Yes. And like split everything right down the middle? No. You combine everything there's no middle. The preacher didn't say and now you're a joint venture he said and now you're one. So what if one person makes more than the other like? You're not a partnership you're a marriage. There is no let me give you an example okay? Okay. My my wife has not had an earned income for 30 years she stayed home with our children. I do not have an income. We have an income. It's as much hers as it is mine. Spiritually, morally, and by the way legally. Okay. And so it's it's our income and she and I sit down. Were she to earn an income it would be in the pot put on a pile with mine and I don't get more votes if I make more money. Okay. We both have a vote. We both are going to sit down together. We love each other. We are going to decide about our you're hearing my pronouns here we our not yours mine it's not my car your car. Now we do say that's her car because she drives that car most of the time but she's more than welcome to drive any car we have. I'm more than welcome to drive any car we have. It's not it's not titled exclusively to her name or to my name. It's ours. We own everything. The only thing that is not ours is if the dog poops on the floor that's my dog. But other than that we share it. See if you change your language like that what it forces you to do is it forces you to set goals together instead of having independent goals. Marriages are always growing together or they're growing apart.

Created on 2025-01-27 20:11:55+00:00) want to win with money, let me give you a good idea. Figure out what most people are doing and run in the other direction. Run in the other direction. Most people are broke. Most people look good and they're broke. They spend more than they have coming in. They don't act their wage. They don't live on a plan. They don't agree on spending with their spouse. Their only hope for retirement is that the government, which is well known for its ability to handle money, will take care of them. They don't have money set aside for emergencies. They run credit card debt and student loans and car debt all day every day. They spend like they're in Congress. Most people are stupid when it comes to money. 70% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. The bankruptcy rate is at an all-time high and foreclosures are rising again. Credit card debt continues to climb and we have a trillion dollars in student loan debt out there. The average car payment in America today now is $496 over 84 months. That's stupid. Normal in America is broke and stupid. You don't want to be normal. You want to be weird. One of the greatest compliments you can get on this show is if you call up and I say, man you're weird. When the culture has lost its way, the best thing you can do is be opposite. Figure out whatever they're doing and do the other thing, right? Because you're not gonna get, you're only gonna get what they're getting when you do what they're doing. This is not hard to figure out. If you keep doing what you've been doing, you're gonna keep getting what you've been getting. You do reap what you sow. You live in a cause and effect world, baby. There's no way around this. So your goal, when I went broke, I realized my goal is to be weird. My goal is to be different. And personal finance is 80% behavior. It's only 20% head knowledge. So this is not some math formula that you've got a problem with. This is a person in your mirror. I figured out if I can make the guy in my mirror behave, he can be skinny and rich. He's got issues. And once we realize that behavior is what causes people to handle their money poorly or handle it well, then what we've got to decide is our behaviors. And if you have the same behaviors as broke people have when it comes to money, you're gonna have the same results broke people have. You're just gonna be another broke person.

Created on 2023-04-11 16:19:57+00:00) have probably just under a million dollars in debt and we want to know how to get that free without filing bankruptcy. Okay how much of that is a mortgage? The mortgage about 210. So you have six hundred thousand dollars in what? 335 is about in student loans. We both have advanced degrees and then a lot the rest is really credit cards and personal loans. So you have three hundred thousand dollars of credit cards and personal loans? We have about three hundred thirty-five thousand student loans and about a hundred thirty-six thousand in credit cards, forty-four thousand personal loans, and thirty-five thousand car loans. Okay how old are you? I'm 29. Okay so what in the world? So yeah. Are you both on this or is this just one of you that's completely lost your mind? Well I have the majority of the student loans and he has the majority of the credit cards. My credit card debt is about, it's not great. So why does he at 29 years old run up a hundred grand in credit card debt? Well he's 32 but I think it's one of those things where just making really poor financial decisions thinking be able to pay it down as you go and it doesn't it doesn't happen. Okay so you both have advanced degrees. What are your degrees in? We do. So I have a degree in both of our advanced degrees. No he has an MBA and I have an advanced degree in policy. I work in the government and we actually both do now at this point. Okay so your household income is what? Our household income is about $230. Okay. Is there recognition on both of your parts how absurd this situation is? Yes. Okay. Yes there is. So I think we're both a bit scared and want to do anything we can to avoid. Okay great. Then I'm on your team. I can skip that step. Okay good. Okay well you're you're scared and you should be. You're disgusted and you should be. We are. You're early in the early stages of being sick and tired and being sick and tired and you should be. So here's the thing. You guys have been living at across the board from your education choices to your car purchases to your whatever. You've been living at about 10x where you're going to get to live for the next three years. Okay yep that's true. So I'm getting ready to destroy your life as you know it because your life your lifestyle is considerably above your extremely good income and has been for a period of time and so you've gotten used to spending like you're in Congress. Right. This is going to be very emotional for y'all and you're going to have to look at it through that lens and through a spiritual lens or you're not going to make it. You're going to have to not care what anyone thinks including each other because you're not going to spend any money on anything ever for the next three years.

You attack the little one with a vengeance scorched earth lifestyle. Sell so much stuff the kids think they're next. Take 16 extra jobs. We're getting out of debt. And you pay everything. You stop all investing temporarily and completely focus all your emotional, spiritual, financial, relational energy on that smallest debt. Everything goes on that one. When that one's gone, you take the payment that used to be there and any other money we can squeeze out of our budget and we throw it at number two. And when that one's gone, we take the payments from one and two. The snowball rolls over again. It picks up more snow and you attack number three. The average person for the past 25 years that has done that with great focused intensity, gone crazy to the point their broke friends and relatives thought they needed counseling. They shaved their head. They drank the Kool-Aid. They get out of debt in about 18 to 24 months. Everything but their house.

Created on 2023-02-23 18:11:43+00:00) If you are behind on your payments, how do you do a budget? You have to prioritize your dollars. And that means we're going to take care of what we used to learn, and they no longer teach it in the 8th grade, called civics. The difference in necessities and luxuries, food. There's one. No, eating out is not a necessity. Some of you people, all you know how to make is reservations. And you gotta work on that, okay? So food at home, cheap, that you bought at the grocery store, with a coupon. Food is a necessity. Utilities, lights and water, so you have heat. Once you've gotten food and utilities, we're bellies full and we're warm, number three is shelter. So you take care of your place to live, so you're not homeless, you pay your rent. Now almost everyone can scratch around and make enough money to buy their food, keep their electricity current, if they're first, second and third, and keep your rent paid. And if you'll just get real calm, cool and collected and go, we're going to eat before we do anything, not eat out. We're going to pay the utilities, not cable, before we do anything. We're going to pay rent. And when you do those three things, you got a lot of money, most of you, left over after those three things. The next one's transportation. And until you clear food, utilities, housing and transportation and get them all current, you don't spend anything else on anything. Food, shelter, transportation and utilities, get current on them before you worry about anything else. Everyone else can jump in the creek until that's done.

The price alone doesn't tell you much, but investors can use something called the PE ratio. That stands for price to earnings, and it's one of the stats you can use to value a company across similar companies. Let me explain. For 10, we have a burger shop called Al's Burgers. They trade for $20 per share on the stock market, and their earnings per share is $2. So therefore, investors are currently paying $10 for every $1 of earnings they generate, meaning that's a PE ratio of 10. Now, Bob's Burgers enters the chat, and their share price is also $20. They're actually much more profitable though, and their earnings per share is $4. That means people are currently paying $5 for every $1 of earnings, or a PE ratio of five. So Al's has a much higher stock price relative to how much they actually earn, so that could mean they're overvalued relative to Bob's Burgers. So Bob's is comparably the better deal. PE ratios vary across all types of industries and companies, so you always need to compare within the same industry. In the case of Apple versus Google, Google trades at a 24 PE compared to Apple's 36.98, so there may be an argument that Google is undervalued relatively to Apple. However, there's much more to investing than just one stat, and I'm gonna make more videos on it, so make sure to follow me for more.

For stocks, the S&P 500 has averaged 10% per year since 1925 or the past 100 years or so. Real estate, however, has returned about 4.2% since 1928, according to the latest data from NYU Stern. With real estate, it's more common to use leverage to multiply returns, as well as there are depreciation strategies to increase your overall return as well. Lastly, crypto. Oh boy, Bitcoin has exploded 100,000% since 2010, but of course it comes with a ton of extreme volatility. It experienced a minus 84% drop from December 2017 to December 2018, which wiped out a lot of crypto investors. There are pros and cons to each of these, but which one are you choosing? Let me know in the comments.

It comes down to the idea that demand for gas is what's called inelastic. Gas is an item people buy that just doesn't have many substitutes. When prices of goods go up, the demand for it should decrease. But with inelastic demand, when the price of gas, say, goes up, the quantity demanded just decreases by a smaller percentage. Demand is relatively unresponsive to price changes in the case of gas because people need this item to drive, even if prices go up. Other goods that are like this could include eggs and milk. But what about goods that are elastic? In other words, they act the opposite. These are much more common and refer to anything that you buy much less of just because the price went up. So if price goes up, demand goes down a lot. Examples include luxury cars, designer clothing, airline tickets, or even concerts. Pricing is super fascinating when it comes to business and economics because if you price something incorrectly, your business could fail. But if the price is right, you could thrive.

But a common mistake people make is that they believe that their entire income is now taxed at 22%, leaving them to make less money, which is just not true. Here's how it actually works. In the first tax bracket, any amount of money you make up to $11,925 per year is taxed at 10%. Then the amount of money you make from 11,926 to 48,745 is taxed at 12%. You see, only dollars that you make in that corresponding bracket are taxed at that rate. In the case of the raise, you'll only pay 22% in taxes on any dollars above 48,476. So for a $50,000 salary, that means only 1524 of it is taxed at 22%. The rest of your salary is taxed at those lower rates, giving you an effective total rate of 12.1%. So making more money is always better. If you enjoy videos about finance and investing, follow me for more.

Number one is that investment income is taxed wildly differently than at your job. So if you make $100,000 in investment income, you'll get taxed at long-term capital gains rates or 15%, $15,000. That same $100,000 in a salary job, you're paying 22.4% in total tax. So what does that tell you? You should probably invest. Number two, any Roth retirement accounts. So these are accounts where all your profits that you make are tax-free and they're so overpowered that the government only lets you put in $7,000 per year if you're under the age of 50 or 8K per year over the age of 50. And number three, QBI deductions. America always encourages small businesses and small business owners and certain freelancers can get up to a 20% deduction on business profits. For example, if you make $190,000 in business income through an LLC, sole proprietorship, S Corp, or any entity with a pass-through income, your total tax owed is $29,522. If you made that at a job, you would owe $36,888 on federal income tax alone. So if you're able to understand how the system is set up and how it incentivizes different people to make money, you're going to be much better off. Follow me if you want a part two of this.

And this is typically the largest holding of any portfolio that I start and it's up 80% in the past five years. Next, I would add $200 of QQQ. That's the ETF giving you exposure to tech and software companies. It's done really well in the past five years, plus 128%. Then I would put $300 into individual stocks. So I would choose three stocks and put $100 into each of them. You want companies that will be around in 40 years. So think of your Apples, your Googles, or your JP Morgans of the world. It's important to not buy any penny stocks. My last $100 is staying in a high yield savings account in cash, waiting for opportunities. And I think this split provides a lot of diversification to stocks via ETFs, as well as you get some concentration into stable long-term companies.

Jetsuite X is the airline that lets you fly semi-privately and for this comparison I flew between LA and San Francisco and I started my timer when the airline announced boarding. For my United flight it took 54 minutes after they announced boarding for us to take off and after a 52 minute flight time I finally got out. All right just got out of the plane two hours and five minutes and about four seconds. Before I reveal how much time JSX saves let's look at the fare difference. For United I paid $135 for my flight to LA and Jetsuite X was $299 for one way. So is the time savings worth the cost? We're gonna break that down but first here's how long it took me. It took one hour and 37 minutes on Jetsuite X for the same segment thereby saving me about 28 minutes. Since the fare difference was $163 to save about a half hour if you value your time and around $330 per hour JSX becomes worth it on just the boarding 2D planning process. I'd also estimate you save about an hour each way because you have light security, you can arrive 20 minutes before your flight, and you don't have to navigate any terminals. Of course this is dependent on how early you get to the airport etc but I'm gonna leave up a breakdown of my times in particular and if you like this video make sure to follow me for more.

First, you wanna pick a brokerage you're comfortable with like Fidelity, Schwab, or M1 Finance and click open an account. Click on retirement and IRAs and then right here, you'll wanna choose open a Roth IRA. Then you need to fill out this. It's some basic information like your name, address, et cetera In your IRA dashboard, make sure to click contribute now. Once you connect your bank account, you can contribute to the Roth IRA. Now the contribution limit, I don't know if you can see this is $7,000 per year or $8,000 per year if you're over the age of 50. Personally, I would just automate it with a monthly recurring transaction of around 300 to $500 per month. Once you have some money in your Roth IRA, you wanna buy some index funds that will grow over time. So the S&P 500 has been growing 8% to 10% annually since it was started. Ticker symbols for that include VOO, SPY, FX, AIX, as well as VFIX. If you get average returns in the market for 40 years, your future balance is going to be $2.365 million. And the crazy part is is that you only contributed about $280,000, the rest is your return. Make sure to follow me for more finance videos like these on your page.

Created on 2025-02-04 17:45:24+00:00) This is how much I made in interest in my high yield savings account for the last three months. Now this includes my emergency fund as well as my savings for a down payment on a future house. So I personally keep about six months of expenses in an emergency fund. And for me, that looks like about $30,000 which I know sounds like a little bit on the high end but I like that peace of mind and it's about 5K a month. Then I have about 132K that I've been accumulating over the years as extra money for a down payment or investment property. I don't wanna invest these funds since I actually might need them soon. So therefore it just stays in my high yield account. In February, I made about $577. Now in January, I made $633.05. And in December, I made $630.15. The reason for the decrease recently is that the Federal Reserve lowered their interest rates a couple months ago. So my January interest was a tad lower. Still though, I get about a 4.5% return on my high yield savings through Wealthfront. And I love the fact that I got paid around $1,840 extra these past three months for literally doing nothing, just existing.

Created on 2025-02-03 15:37:35+00:00) President Trump officially imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, as well as 10% on Chinese goods over the weekend. The market today is reacting awfully because of it. As you can see, everything's in the red. Economists have predicted that tariffs will cause inflation and lower GDP growth, but why do tariffs cause inflation and should we be worried? If a toy costs $10 and Walmart imports it from say Canada, Walmart will now have to pay an extra $2.50 to US customs, thus probably passing on that cost likely to customers. A tariff then would incentivize the US based supplier like Walmart to seek out American made toys instead of Canadian ones. This will also hurt Canada and Mexico's economy way more than it hurts the United States, because currently nearly 80% of both Canada and Mexico's exports go to United States. On the US side, about 16% of US exports go to Canada and Mexico respectively. I think this is just a negotiation tactic by Trump because Canada and Mexico won't be able to sustain this for a long period of time. Both of their economies are more reliant on the US than the US is reliant on them. Now, will the real impact of these tariffs last? Well, I definitely could see GDP being affected as well as inflation. However, I do think that Trump knew all of these things going into it. If you're investing for the long term, such as your retirement, I don't think you need to do anything. Don't abandon your investing plans. However, if you are invested for the short term, such as the next few months, I don't think these tariff issues will be solved until at least the end of Q1. What do you think? Let me know in the comments.

It depends entirely on how long you hold the stock as well as if you actually sold the stock. You'll owe taxes when you realize the profit, so that's when you actually sell the stock for a gain. So let's say you sell Apple stock and you realize a $10,000 gain in profit. If you held it for less than one year, you will owe short-term capital gains taxes, and that is taxed at your federal marginal tax rate. So if you make $120,000 per year, that puts you in the 24% marginal tax bracket, that means you will owe $2,400 in taxes on the gain of 10,000. If you're able to hold it for more than a year, your long-term capital gains rate then becomes 0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on your income. In this case, you would owe $1,500 in taxes if you sold it after owning it for more than one year. Now, keep in mind, if you just buy and hold and you don't sell at all, then you don't owe any taxes yet. It's only when you sell the stock.

Well, new, it's going to cost you $45,950, but you should never buy it new because after one year, the resale value is 21% less or $36,000. Cars are depreciating assets, which means that they lose value over time. If you Google car depreciation curve, you can see that all of them go downwards, but we can actually use this to save money. To get the most value, we wanna buy a car after the fourth year of depreciation. That's a used car sweet spot. In the case of the BMW, if you wait four years, that car's only gonna cost you $27,000 or about 51% less. I like to buy a car that's three to four years used, maybe has 15 to 20,000 miles on it, and is perhaps a lease turn back, and then I'm gonna buy it in cash. Follow me for more.

Number one is to start a budget and track how much you spend. Now, a good rule of thumb is to use the 50-30-20 rule. That's where 50% of your budget goes towards needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings. Second is to write down your net worth every quarter or every year to see if it's trending in the right direction. Personally, I tally all my bank accounts and investment accounts, and then I subtract any liabilities or debt that I have, and I try to track it on a regular basis. This habit increases your net worth because you're now paying attention to it, and I'll have a free net worth tracker for you guys down below. Number three is to invest your money and get it to work for you. I talk a lot about investing on this page, but by doing so, you're ensuring that your money isn't just sitting there losing value to inflation. If you're just getting started, putting money into index funds like the S&P 500 are a great way to start, so ticker symbols VOO or SPY. Let me know down below your net worth if you're comfortable in the comments.

Created on 2025-01-28 21:20:44+00:00) If you're able to make your first 100K, the next 100K is a lot easier. Assuming you save 10K per year at a 7% return, it takes you 7.84 years to hit your first 100K, but the next 100K, since your money is working for you, would take you 5.1 years. Fast forward, and we can see that all subsequent 100K increments, each one is faster than the previous. You have money working for you and it's continuing to compound, and as you invest, it's like rolling a giant snowball down the hill. Look at the time between the 400K and 500K mark. You can see it's 2.5 years, and comparing that to the first 100K, it's a lot faster, but don't worry, it gets crazier still. By the time you're approaching the $1 million mark from the $900,000 mark, it's only going to take you 1.35 years for that same 100K. The first 100K takes you 25.5% of the total time it takes to get to a million dollars. The remaining 900K only takes 74.5% of the time, so that's pretty funny. It's like when you hit 100K, you're basically a quarter of the way to a million dollars. I know that sounds weird, but in terms of time, it's true.

Created on 2025-01-27 20:04:39+00:00) Tech and AI stocks are tanking hard today with NVIDIA down over 15%. And the reason is because of Chinese startup DeepSeek. It's the number one app in the top free apps. They released an AI model last week that basically rivals LLMs like ChadGBT, and it was created for a fraction of the cost. They claim around $6 million. Investors are worried because it was created without access to NVIDIA's most powerful chips, and NVIDIA's growth and share price relies on the AI industry actually needing those chips. Basically, current market and price levels are super reliant on future AI profits as well as the industry growing. DeepSeek is a huge threat to all that because if some startup from China can come in and do it for a very limited budget without the need for these chips, then the entire AI industry is now called into question. I do feel like the stock price of NVIDIA today seems like an overreaction, but valuations were high already, as you can see, and the S&P 500 is still overvalued compared to what it typically is. And some people on the internet don't believe that it only costs $6 million. Personally, I'm a little skeptical as well, but until we find out more, I'm not entirely sure that this is the end of the AI industry just yet.

Created on 2025-01-26 21:59:25+00:00) If you make the same amount of money as your friend or somebody you know, one of you could be rich versus the other one could end up broke. But why is that? There are three big reasons why that could happen. Now, the first is lifestyle inflation. So in this book, The Millionaire Next Door, the author found that people who often look well off are usually deeply in debt. Physicians and lawyers, for example, usually earn above average incomes, but they also tend to drive luxury cars and live in larger homes because they want to live in the same neighborhoods that their colleagues do. Common mistake number two is being burdened by too much debt. So if your friend has $5,000 in credit card debt for just one year, that's $5,000 they aren't investing. In that single year alone, that $5,000 could grow to over $50,000 in 30 years. Third, there's a lack of tracking or budgeting the money itself. So it's really easy to spend frivolously without knowing the full repercussions of how much you're spending versus how much you're not. If you track your money, you'll have a clear understanding of where your money is going and you won't be as likely to overspend. Do you know anyone that makes a good income yet they're broke? Let me know down below.

Created on 2025-01-26 00:02:09+00:00) You're gonna make your first 100K, it's not gonna come from investing, and that's something that people don't get. Pretend you get average gains in the market of 8% per year and start with $10,000, it would still take you 30 years to hit $100,000 just investing that sum, and nobody wants to wait that long. Charlie Munger, who was Warren Buffet's right-hand man, said it best, the first $100,000 is a bitch, but you gotta do it, I don't care what you have to do. So your first $100,000 actually comes mostly from saving every dollar and investing on top of that. If you save 12K a year for seven years at a 4.5% return, you will have $100,000, but look, 84% of it came from savings, and only 16% of it came from the interest in gains. A lot of the friction in building wealth is at the beginning of the journey, so every dollar when you're starting out saving matters that much more. I hope this helps.

So you gotta make sure you're protecting your money against inflation, and here are three options. Number one is just investing. The easiest way to beat the inflation rate is to invest in the market. So on average, the stock market returns about eight to 10% per year. And if you invest in index funds, you can buy the entire market just with one purchase. The second are treasury inflation protected securities, also known as TIPS. Now, these are government bonds that adjust their principal value with inflation. These aren't perfect by any means, but currently they provide around a 2.2% return above the inflation rate. Number three, you could consider real estate, which generally appreciates over time. Now, keep in mind that this isn't perfect either, but in general, property values and rental income tend to rise with inflation. As long as your money is working for you somehow, it's better than keeping it in a bank account that yields 0.01%. An easy option anybody can do is a high yield savings account for the time being while they pay about 4% per year.

Created on 2025-01-22 22:12:50+00:00) Everyone tells you to get a Roth IRA, but no one tells you what to invest in. Here are three options to invest in with the riskiest one being last. First option are index funds and ETFs tracking the S&P 500. These are low to medium risk over a long-term time horizon and you'll set it and forget it. And it should on average return about 8 to 10% per year. Second, you could go with a three fund portfolio. That's where you have a US stock market index fund, an international stock market index fund and a bond fund. This is more diversified than the first option. So lower risk in general and is overall a solid choice. Third are individual stocks, especially mega caps. Since the Roth IRA gives you tax-free gains, you wanna take full advantage of that with holdings that have high upside. These are riskier, but having a few positions of companies of the caliber of Apple, Google, or Amazon could be good. $1,000 in Apple stock 20 years ago is worth more than $700,000 today. And if you invested in a Roth IRA, then all of those gains would be tax-free. That's the power of it.

Created on 2025-01-22 18:01:24+00:00) Here's what cell phone service bills were in the 1980s to today and how they've changed. In the 1980s, the DynaTAC was rolled out costing $3,995 and you'd get around 30 minutes of talk time and it's projected that those plans cost a few hundred dollars per month. Now in the 1990s, the Bureau of Labor Statistics cited cell services costing around $50 per month with limited talk time and some data usage. Now in the 2000s, the cost of cell phone services ranged but you could get your phone covered for about $30 per month. As more competitors entered the market, prices went down. However, by the 2010s, the introduction of smartphones and data plans meant that cell phone plans started to cost an average of $113 per month for one line with unlimited data, talk and text. But what if you could pay only $25 per month? Metro offers just that with their BYOD or bring your own phone plan. All you have to do is bring the phone you want to add the service to and pay $25 per month. You get unlimited 5G on one line with no contracts or credit checks.

Created on 2025-01-21 19:37:15+00:00) is how I would invest $10,000 if I were starting all over again. First, I'd invest $5,000 into an S&P 500 ETF like VOO or SPY. This is going to be the foundation of your portfolio and it's up 83% in the past five years. Second, I'm adding another $3,000 into QQQ. That's the ETF that gives you exposure to the software and tech companies. And in the past five years, it's up 135%. Third, I'm going to add $2,000 into a high yield savings account. And that way I always have some cash on hand in case there are any opportunities to buy up any dips. Let me know if you have any questions. I'll also have some free downloads in my profile.

Bitcoin is the guy that microdoses LSD for breakfast, he lives in an apartment that looks like this, and one day he's spending 5k at the club, but then the next day he's asking you for money. He talks about changing the system, but he can't even commit to dinner plans. Financial stocks are like artists full of potential, one year they can be flying you around the world because they're mega successful, but then society kind of weighs a little bit heavier on them, they're a little bit sensitive, so when people start to talk bad about them, they go into a dark, deep depression, and their stock price falls because of it too. Gold is the old money guy and talks about legacy, he's reliable in tough times, goes skiing in Aspen, and he's going to be happy when everyone else is miserable. And it's especially true when times are tough in the world.

The 401k itself is not an investment. It is how the investment is treated under section 401k or section 401 subsection K of the IRS code, meaning that you're allowed to have money taken out of your check and put into an investment pre-tax and then it grows tax free if it's a Roth 401k tax deferred if it's a regular 401k. Now, what's been underperforming is not the actual 401k. It's more like the coat that is keeping the investment warm. It's the investment inside the coat that sucked. If you had an underperforming 401k, what you really had was an underperforming investment in your 401k. Does that make sense? Sort of, and what do you mean by that? Okay, pretend like there's a cookie jar and that's the investment with the cookies. The cookies in the cookie jar are either good or bad. The jar doesn't determine that. The jar is just where you park the cookies. That make sense? Yes. You could have peanut butter cookies, you could have sugar cookies, you could have chocolate chip cookies and they could be good cookies or they could suck, but the jar didn't cause any of that to happen. The jar's just where you have them. The 401k is the jar, the investment is the cookies. So we basically, at the three places I've worked at, they didn't really have the right investment. Or you didn't pick the right ones from the ones that they offered. Right, there was four on each one of them. No, there was four general portfolios on each one of them and you picked the wrong portfolio, but you probably could have gone even inside of those four portfolios, meaning they had a low risk, a medium risk, and a high risk or something like that. And that high risk would have had a group of mutual funds in it that would have sounded a lot like what we tell you to do and you would have done a lot better had you been in that versus the one you were in. And so what you're looking for is you're looking for mutual funds inside the 401k, whether there's a match or not. A match is helpful, obviously, because it's freaking free money. But you're looking for mutual funds inside the 401k that have a good long-term track record. And I personally, in my 401k here at my business, do this and I recommend that other people do the same thing, that you put it in four types of mutual funds. Growth, growth and income, aggressive growth, and international. And that's the cookies, okay? You summon a chocolate chip cookie, you want some peanut butter cookie, you want some sugar cookie and so on, right? Some Oreos or whatever, I'm just making this up as I go here. But the bottom line is that you're trying to get different kinds of investments that have good long-term track records and they fall under the heading of growth stock mutual funds inside the 401k. You can also do that inside a Roth. And if you don't like the options that your company has available to you to invest inside the 401k and there's no match, then you could go to just a Roth IRA, do the exact same thing and pick from any of 8,000 mutual funds. So certainly you could get a good one that way.

Whatever happened in the past, yeah, we'll glance back there and make sure we don't do it again and run over somebody else. But right here, this is all options in front of us, right? Listen, mistakes don't define you, they refine you. You screwed up this morning, so what? Start again, right now. Take another step. If you keep taking a step, you can get anywhere, guys. The trick is just don't quit, right?

Together we have a total of $137,000 in student loans, where mine is over $111,000 and his is a lot less. Did he know this when you got married? Yes sir, he did. Did he say the vows at the altar that said for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, unto thee all my worldly goods I pledge? Yes sir, he did. Did he mean it? I hope so. Then why are your finances not combined? Because he's nervous about my family and how I handle my finances with them. You give your family money without talking to your husband? Well, before we got married I used to live with my parents, so I pay for half of the mortgage and I pay for other bills. Still? And still, yes. After you got married, you pay half the mortgage for somebody else when you have $111,000 in student loan debt? Yes sir. Why? Because my parents are in their 80s and they don't work. Do they not have Social Security? We're not from this country, so no sir. Okay. Did your husband know that you were obligated to take care of your 80 year old parents when you got married? He did, but he also would like some help from my siblings and that's one part where I'm nervous to talk to my siblings about it. I'm not. It's overdue. I agree with your husband. He would like to combine our finances, but because of the situation that I'm in, he doesn't know how to go about doing that. Yeah. Well, the way he would go about it is is that the two of you come into agreement on what you are willing to do to support your parents. When you lived there, it was perfectly logical that you took care of half the mortgage because you were a roommate with them. Now that you don't live there anymore and you have your own household, it now becomes a charitable act to aging parents that you take care of the mortgage, which should be shared with siblings. I agree with him. Yes sir. Yesterday, like before you got married, this should have been talked about to your siblings. I'm moving out and we're all taking care of mom and dad split-seas. Yes sir. That's where I have to start doing that. Yeah, and I think you know you agree to do that. So you think your siblings aren't going to want to take care of your parents? I'm sure that they would if they could, but all of them. I don't come from a financially stable household. We were never taught how to save or do any of that. So everyone is working paycheck to paycheck. Gotcha. And how much does it take to support your mom and dad? It would be about $2,000 U.S. Are they in the U.S.? Yes. Okay, per month. My siblings, most of them are not. Okay, $2,000 U.S. per month. Yes, that's covering... And what is your household income, you and your new husband? Our household income after tax is $80,976. Okay, so you're making about $102,000, $103,000 right? Yes sir. Okay, well that's pretty good news. And your siblings, how many of them are there? I have seven in total. Okay, well here's what it sounds like if I'm at your house. You guys have to talk this through, okay? We can't put your parents in the street. No. That is not an option. No. Okay, what do your parents have? Any income or any assets? Not in the U.S. Okay, what income and assets do they have outside the U.S.? If they went back home, they have their own property and they don't have much expenses there. Right, and so where is home? Belize, Central America. Okay, and what is that property worth were they to sell it? Probably about $60,000 U.S. And that would take care of about 30 months? Yes, but I have one brother living there, so we can't sell that one. Oh, we can sell it. He can move and rent. It's not his property. This is so... I mean, listen, I understand taking care of your parents and I want you to be doing that. I don't want to put old people in the street. That is not my heart, but I agree with your husband that there's a toxic thing going on here and the only one that's getting ridden is you. Yeah. Nobody else is doing what they're supposed to do in this whole story. Your parents aren't selling their property. Your brothers and sisters aren't chipping in what they can chip in. Now, if I were your husband, I would say, listen, I am fine helping to support them as long as everybody puts in something. Not necessarily equal, because I understand they're in a different country. They don't necessarily have the income, but everybody puts in something. I don't care if it's $50. Everybody puts in something, and the property back home is being sold. Yes, sir. Let's pretend you were broke. What would they do? We don't have to pretend. No, I mean, that's true, because you got $111,000 in student loan debt, but I'm saying, let's pretend you didn't have any options here to participate. What would happen to mom and dad? They would sell the property back home to keep from being in the street, or they'd move back home and live in that property. One of the two, wouldn't they? Yes. Ta-da. Okay, and once we combine our finances and get that out, what would be your best advice for us to tackle this huge loan that we have? Head on as fast as you can, living on nothing. It's going to be somewhat slowed by the money you use to help take care of your parents, and I suggest to your husband that he agree to something where you do participate in taking care of your parents if the property is sold and the other siblings participate at some level, but if they're all going to leave it all on you, I'm going to leave it all on them and let them figure it out, because I think they're being stubborn and milking you like you're a cow. I think everybody's got a place to play here, and nobody's playing but you. So if I'm your husband, I would have to be willing to take care of your mom and dad, but not when no one else is participating.

Created on 2025-02-13 17:39:40+00:00) If people aren't making fun of you, you're probably not on track. Because people are stupid. People are broke. Because if you look around, 70% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. You want to be that? I don't want to be that. When I hit bottom, I mean, I didn't hit bottom, I completely splatted. I know what stupid looks like. I looked that boy in the mirror. I know who he is. And so you don't want to live like that. But your foundational stuff is to at least get rid of your debt, not counting your home. And at least get you a rainy day fund. You have to look in the mirror and look at each other as a married couple or as a single. Look in the mirror and say, no, we're not going on vacation. We're broke. We have two car payments and a credit card loan, credit card debt and a student loan that's been around so long we think it's a pet. No, we're not going to strut around acting like we're something we're not. It's time to lay these basic steps out and lay into them and say, that's it. I'm tired of being broke. I worked too stinking hard to be this broke.

Two is pay off all your debts except your home using the debt snowball where you list your debts, smallest to largest, and pay them off in that order with great focused intensity. Once you're out of debt, then you go back to the $1,000 account in baby step three and raise it up to a fully funded emergency fund of three to six months of expenses. You need to run like your hair's on fire until you get those three steps done. You need to be in a panic until you get those three steps done. Just think about your life right now. How would that feel? No payments, but a house payment and 15 or 20,000 or $10,000 laying there. You're not even there yet and you just started breathing better. Just thinking about it. But until you get there, you're just scrapping and clawing like a rat in a wheel, man. And so you have to break the cycle. You've got to get so fired up and wired up that your broke friends think you've lost your mind.

Created on 2025-02-11 21:22:13+00:00) I was studying at West Point, and when I went abroad my senior year, I acted a fool and got myself kicked out right before I graduated, so now I owe the government about $300,000. And while I was there, I also took out a personal loan of about $35,000. I recently got married in May, and my wife, she can't work right now because we're waiting on her green card. I bounced around a few jobs since then, and the one I'm working on now is on a bad job, but I'm not particularly passionate about it. And I'm actually on my way now to do my orientation for Domino's. I'm going to go deliver pizzas as a side job, but I don't really know what to do. I had my career path to be in the Army, and I thought I was going to figure it out then, but right now I'm just, I don't know, I feel like I'm working, and to pay off all those debts is going to take me a long time, I feel like. Yeah, how old are you? 24. So you are how close to graduating from West Point? The day before, they told me I was getting separated. Oh man, I'm so sorry. What a disaster. Yeah, well, I mean, I'm the one that misbehaved, but I take responsibility for that. I understand. It's a tough situation. Yeah, you did it, but what a mess. The, so I am not positive, I mean, obviously that is the preeminent military war college. Do those college credits transfer to another college? Yes, yes, I actually transferred them and was able to get my degree last month. Okay, that's good news. In what? I got one of those stupid majors you talk about, because I plan on being in the Army, but it's in Russian studies. Okay, but that was the closest thing for you to finish. Yes, sir, I ended up finishing up with the same degree I was studying at West Point. Right, okay, but at least you come out with a degree. Okay. All right. Oh my goodness. Well, I think, you know, what I'm going to do, what drew you to Russian studies while you're in the military? What was your, obviously you were studying it from a military aspect, is that right? Right, and I just fell in love with the language. I was originally a math and econ major, but I wanted to go abroad and learn the language and then hopefully get a job in the government agency after. Yeah, okay, here's what I want you to do. I want you to pursue international business with a specialization in Russia, and I want you to learn how to do trade and how to do deals, because you've got these skills. You've got a natural tendency to business with econ and math. You've got the skill set to do that, and you've got this very specialized set of skills, understanding the Russian culture, language, and so forth, agreed? Yes, sir. Yeah, I think that translates to international business, and there is a lot of money flowing in and out of Russia, legal money, not illegal money, as you probably already know, and so, I would lean into that and say that's going to be the salvation of this mess, because you've got a really, really big hole here, and delivering Domino's pizza is not going to get you out of 300 grand. Well, that's my side job. Okay, and your day job is what? I work in a rubber factory. Okay, now making what? I make about $15 an hour, so it's about 30 grand a year. Okay, well, I want you to forgive yourself for your stupidity and reset your career, and go, okay, I'm 24, I did a really dumb thing, it's now in the rearview mirror, I'm not a $15 an hour guy, I'm a $100,000 a year guy, and I'm going to go about becoming a specialist in Russian international business, and I'm going to find a job, and I'm going to find people that work with people in Russia, businesses that interact with that, and I'm going to go work for them, and I'm going to make some serious money to get out of this mess. Even if you didn't have this mess, that would be what you would need to do, because you've got that potential, and I don't want you to take a $15 an hour job, and that is now your future in a factory, because you had, right on the cusp of graduating from one of the world's finest institutions, you did something stupid. That does not need to define your life. It just needs to cause your life to be redirected. Is that okay? Yeah, I think my biggest thing is just not really, you know, my purpose was to serve in the Army, and now, since then, I've just kind of been wandering about. Yep, and it's time to get a new one, brother. Not having a purpose sucks, doesn't it? I'm sitting here trying to give you a new one, because, listen, other than the dumb thing you did, you don't get to the final cut, the final day at West Point, if you're stupid. You're not an ignorant, you're not an unintelligent person, okay? You don't get there. It's not possible. It's too tough. Am I wrong? You're right. Okay, you did a dumb thing. That doesn't make you unintelligent, it makes you a smart guy who did a dumb thing. I can, you put my name on that list, I'm a smart guy who's done a lot of dumb things in my life. So, put it in the rearview mirror, and let's reset our purpose. We're not going that way. Okay, where are we going? There's got to be a different adventure, and it doesn't mean that you are doomed to a life of slavery. Next time I talk to you, I want a little more hope in your voice, a little more energy in your voice, and I want you fired up and wired up about where you're going, because that's the next step in your life, brother, and you're not getting out of this debt with Domino's Pizza and $15. Besides that, it'd be a waste of your life. You're too sharp. There's too much good you can still do, and you can have some fun with the skill set you've got, and you may even be able to get involved in policy and some other stuff in the government position. You don't have to graduate from West Point to use your skill set in a think tank in D.C. somewhere. So, don't camp on the backside of the desert here too long, my brother. You've got stuff to do.

Created on 2025-02-11 17:03:12+00:00) God want me or us to be wealthy? Here's the true idea, okay? God doesn't care if you're wealthy or if you're poor. He doesn't care, one way or the other. All He wants is your heart. All He wants is your worship. And if poverty gets in the way of your worship, that's a problem. If wealth gets in the way of your worship, that's a problem. Those of us that are people of faith, that are people of the book, believe that we don't own anything. We are merely managing it for God. There's all this biblical evidence that we're not supposed to worship wealth and that wealth can be dangerous because it can become an idol. But if we can maintain the distance from it as a manager instead of an owner, if you don't say my my my my my, instead you go, I'm holding this with an open hand, what do you want me to do with it? It's yours. And then you're managing it. If you're faithful with the little things, you'll be given more to manage. But on the other hand, you're not better than someone else. I know some of the highest character, smartest people who are not wealthy. And that does, you know, you're not better than them if you're managing more money than they're managing. You just have more responsibility.

Are we going to have them? How many? How are we going to treat them? The crazy people in our family called in-laws. Everybody's got it. So how are we going to handle that? How are we going to handle the extended crazy and are we going to stand beside each other in that? And it's religion. Agreement on religion. And so if you're in agreement on those four things, you have a very high probability.

Created on 2025-02-08 19:27:45+00:00) You want to win with money? Let me give you a good idea. Figure out what most people are doing and run in the other direction. Run in the other direction. Most people are broke. Most people look good and they're broke. They spend more than they have coming in. They don't act their wage. They don't live on a plan. They don't agree on spending with their spouse. Their only hope for retirement is that the government, which is well known for its ability to handle money, will take care of them. They don't have money set aside for emergencies. They run credit card debt and student loans and card debt all day, every day. They spend like they're in Congress. Most people are stupid when it comes to money. 70% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. The bankruptcy rate is at an all time high and foreclosures are rising again. Credit card debt continues to climb and we have a trillion dollars in student loan debt out there. The average car payment in America today now is $496 over 84 months. That's stupid. Normal in America is broke and stupid. You don't want to be normal. You want to be weird. One of the greatest compliments you can get on this show is if you call up and I say, man, you're weird. I'm looking at weird people. You guys are weird, which means that you're contrary. You are a contrarian. You are perpendicular to the culture. When the culture has lost its way, the best thing you can do is be opposite. Figure out whatever they're doing and do the other thing, right? Because you're not going to get, you're only going to get what they're getting when you do what they're doing. This is not hard to figure out. If you keep doing what you've been doing, you're going to keep getting what you've been getting. You do reap what you sow. You live in a cause a cause and effect world, baby. There's no way around this. So your goal, when I went broke, I realized my goal is to be weird. My goal is to be different. And personal finance is 80% behavior. It's only 20% head knowledge. So this is not some math formula that you've got a problem with. This is a person in your mirror. I figured out if I can make the guy in my mirror behave, he can be skinny and rich. He's got issues. And once we realize that behavior is what causes people to handle their money poorly or handle it well, then what we've got to decide is our behavior. And if you have the same behaviors as broke people have in, when it comes to money, you're going to have the same, you're going to have the same results. Broke people have, you're just going to be another broke person. And some of you are making $250,000 a year and you're broke. You had no money at all. You got a mess loans coming out your ears. You can't breathe. You run, run, run, run, run, run, run. Run, run, run, run. Like a rat in a wheel, have a heart attack and die and wonder what happened. This is no way to live. Buying things you can't afford with money. You don't have to impress people. You don't really like some of you spend an unbelievable amount of money on a car payment to impress somebody at a stoplight. You will never be introduced to the buddy. You felt cool there for about what? Three and a half seconds. Fool. I've been that fool. That's why I know who he is. I've been that guy. I've been that shallow where I thought that my car actually mattered to somebody. Give me a break. Nobody gives a rip about your car. It, listen, if, if you know what I drive right now, anything I want, you know why? Cause I drove crap for a long time. I drove cars like nobody else would drive. Now I get to drive whatever I want to drive. And I don't drive them for you. I drive them because I like them. I couldn't give a careless what you think about what I drive. It's not my problem. It's not your problem either. By the way, I'm going to enjoy, I'm a boy. I like nice cars. I'm going to get, but I'm not going to have a nice car with a stupid car payment on it. It's ridiculous. If your self-esteem is so screwed up that you're doing that, then you're going to struggle with money. You're normal. People spending a bunch of money to act like there's something they're not what they call in Texas, big hat, no cattle. You need to decide. I don't care what other people think. And I'm going to be weird, whatever you're doing with money. I'm going to do the opposite thing. And when you decide that you'll start winning with money. I don't have any credit cards, not a single one. No, I don't believe in points. I've never met a millionaire. So Dave, you know, I made all my money with my airline miles. No stupid people. Don't say that in the real world. I meet middle-class people who spend everything on a credit card because they're racking up points. Not figure this math out for me. You get 1% back on your stupid discover card, right? Have you ever discovered what the math is on that discover card? That means if you spend $100,000, you get $1,000. Is this a path to wealth anywhere? You went to math class. That's just straight up stupid. I mean, in the sixth grade, you should have been able to figure the fourth grade. Third grade. You should have been able to figure that one out that that's not going to work. I mean, you run a hundred grand through a stupid credit card to get a free airline ticket. Give me a break. With what you overspent, you could have bought 10 airline tickets and all in the name of I'm racking up points. I'm beating. You're not beating anybody. They're a multibillion dollar company. They've got done so many behavior studies on you based on your zip code and your demographic. They know what kind of bottled water you drink, fool. They're tracking you. Every movement you make on the web is being followed with web analytics. They know exactly what you're doing. No, this is not a conspiracy theory. They are better at marketing than you are at living your life. And they're selling you so much crap. You're broke. And you're playing their game. You're playing Citibank's game. What's in your wallet? I'll tell you what's in my wallet. Money. That's what's in my wallet. It's not a bunch of stupid plastic. So I'm weird. Dave, you're weird. You're right. I'm not broke. Normal's broke. I don't want to be normal. I engage in weird activities. And so I get weird results. And that's called money. I'm not broke anymore because I do things that broke people don't do. And I don't do things that the broke people do do. Why is this hard? You want to be skinny? Find out what skinny people eat. Eat what they eat. You'll be skinny. You want to be fat? Eat what fat people eat. You will be fat. This is not rocket science, people. Figure it out. You want a great marriage? Well, don't ask somebody who's been divorced six times. We'll pray for them. But I don't need their marriage advice. They ain't got this thing figured out, baby. I want to find somebody that's winning and emulate them. This is not rocket science. Be weird. That's your goal, darling. Be weird. Weird, weird, weird, weird.

Created on 2025-02-07 21:56:10+00:00) Here's how you stay sane. This is what sane means. Sane means that you are acceptable enough to other people so they tell you when you're stupid. Right, because if you have 20 people, well, that's exactly... You distribute the problem of your own sanity. I thought that was marriage. That's right. Well, that's what marriage... Marriage... In a huge part, the advantage of marriage is that, is that, you know, your wife taps you back into position and vice versa. If you're going to be sane, you have to be acceptable to, valued by, and in constant contact with a social group. And then you need to, if you're wise, select your social group carefully. I mean, this is why there were businessmen organizations like the Rotary and the Kinsmen and so forth. And, you know, we see their membership plummeting in recent years. But it was there because people were wise enough to understand that even if you had attained things, you know, on your own as a solitary venture, an entrepreneur, that it was extremely useful to have a community around you. It's not good that men be alone. No, no, no. You, you...

I feel like I really want to spend time raising our little one. Cool. What a great goal. So does he make enough money for you to live on? Yeah, like he makes about $975,000. What's that mean? $975,000. $975,000 a year? Yeah. Okay, I think you could probably freaking struggle through. It's not so much the finances as it is, I think he has a worry that I'll never go back to work. So? Like, I don't know. I think because his mom works like three jobs. So? I know. He makes $975,000. Okay, here's the deal. Sharon Ramsey went home to be a full-time mom when our first daughter was born 34 years ago. Yeah. She has never worked in the workplace since. She is engaged in a lot of ministry boards. She sits on hospital boards. She is engaged in being a full-time Mimi to six grandbabies. She raised three wonderful children. I call that an incredible career. I do too. Okay. I just don't know how to get my husband on the same page. Why does he go do all of that if it's not so that your family can do what they want to do? I know. Like, I just don't see the point in paying like a nanny or daycare. So if you want to be outside the home and have a career and that's your aspiration and you want to do that, then no shame on that either. Absolutely. But but this idea that somehow motherhood is full-time motherhood is not a is somehow to be shamed or to be looked down upon is absolute BS. Moms can't win because if they work they're guilty and if they don't work they're guilty. Mm-hmm. I know. It's like guilt is built into the whole program or something. I don't know what it is. What's a boy child do for a living? We've been together about seven. She's an investment advisor. I guess he is. I'm the writer. Okay. It's so impressive. He's doing so well. I don't know. I think that number one, I just want to give you encouragement and say, A, this is not crazy. It's not irresponsible. As a matter of fact, it is a high dignity position. I mean, this is a high calling and it has dignity, it has value, it has worth equivalent to anything you could do in the workplace. No shame, no guilt, and should be no hesitation financially or economically.

Created on 2025-02-05 16:59:08+00:00) I personally invest in good growth stock mutual funds. I spread it across four types, growth and income, growth, aggressive growth, and international. And I buy mutual funds that have at least a 10-year track record. Let's talk about those for a second because there's all kinds of names for mutual funds. And the name of the mutual fund tells you what is in the fund, OK? A growth and income fund is also called a large cap fund, or sometimes also called a blue chip fund. Now, the blue chip is the most expensive chip on the poker table. So that means these are big companies in this. Large cap is short for large capitalization. Large capitalization means these are large companies. And so your growth and income funds are large companies, boring. Of the four types of mutual funds that I put money into, and I recommend, this is the calmest. If you were to chart this volatility on this fund versus the stock market, you would see it's a lot calmer than the market. And so it's your friend when things are going down, in other words. It's your stable. It's the big old dinosaur companies. They're boring. When things are going up, by the way, it's also boring. It's not exciting when things are going up. It's a downer. You look at that thing going, why is it not doing well when the rest of the market's going up? Because it goes slower than the market up and slower than the market down, because it's a stable land. Stable land. A growth fund is right in the middle. The S&P 500 index fund would be considered a growth fund. A growth fund is companies that are growing. They're kind of medium-sized companies. So you might hear it called mid-cap fund. And so these are just standard growth stock mutual funds. There's a whole lot of these out there. Ton of funds that fall in this area. So the idea is pretty simple. The growth fund, that's kind of right there in the middle. You want something in the middle. It's pretty much going to do about what the market does in terms of volatility, but you can get mutual funds that are growth stock mutual funds that outperform the S&P 500. You can even get growth and income funds, even though they're not as volatile, that outperform the S&P 500. Then there's the aggressive growth fund. This is the wild brother, okay? It's the crazy one. And so you might guess it's going to be also called a small-cap funds. These are the small companies, the startups. A lot of tech companies would fall into there. Very crazy. All the fun, weird stuff is in there. And that means some of it fails and goes to zero. And so it's a crazier mix. It's going to be much more volatile than the stock market is. So it's going to go up faster than the market goes up, but it's going to go down faster than the market goes down. Small-cap aggressive growth stock mutual funds. Also known in there as, let's see, small-cap aggressive growth. Oh, emerging market. You would call it that too as well. International funds means that the stocks in it are our overseas companies. They're not American companies. It has a kissing cousin called a global fund. If you think of a globe, what is it? It's everything. So that would have international and US companies in a global fund. And it would be a cousin to an international. By the way, American companies generally outperform other international companies by and large as a group. And so your international fund will be your worst performing of the four over the last several decades. And a global fund will outperform an international fund because you put some spice in there. You put some American companies in there usually. And so they're a little bit better, but at least you got some stuff overseas. You're not 100% betting on the American economy. Not that I'm anti-American. I am not. This is not a patriotic thing. This is a diversification thing. And so you want to have some BMW and some Mercedes in there. You want to have some LG and some other stuff. Even though some of those things are made stateside, those are foreign companies. And so you look for companies that are overseas based, could be a French company, could be whatever, and that are in an international fund. And then you spread your investing across those four types. You know, very simple here. Very simple. The thing is, do it. That's the thing. Everybody talks and talks and talks and talks and talks about investing. The problem is nobody does it. The people we talked to on the Millionaire Theme Hour that are millionaires, you know how they got to be millionaires? They did it.

Because your most powerful wealth-building tool is your income. And when you haven't committed your income in the form of payments to everybody else, you can invest it and become wealthy. Really. The average car payment in America today is $503. That's just cray-cray. That's nutty. If you invest $500 in a decent growth stock mutual fund from age 30 to age 70, you'll have over $5 million. That one thing will make you worth $5 million. Getting out of the land to car payments, just staying out of them. Isn't that amazing? And so I've become known for getting people out of debt, and the only reason I get people out of debt is because it increases their generosity and increases their ability to invest and become wealthy, which also increases their generosity. And it changes your life. It changes your family tree. It changes your retirement. You retire with dignity. You don't have to buy that cookbook, 72 Ways to Prepare Alpo, and love it. You can retire with dignity. But you have to do it on purpose. And getting out of debt in order to invest is the shortest way.

I'm just really torn because I love my home and I love my neighborhood, but I just want to be able to pay my debt off and provide better for my son. Okay. Uh, so you own the home with your boyfriend or? No, sir. It's just me. You own it. Yeah. Okay. Um, when is he leaving? Uh, that's a great question. Well, I'll give you the answer tonight. I can hear it. No, no. I can hear it in your voice. You sound really afraid to me. Yeah. Well, I'm trying to talk to you outside and he's actually standing next to me cause she can't go inside. Okay. Um, I have about $16,000 worth of debt. Um, and it includes a car credit card, the medical debt from the birth of our son that I get no help with. Yeah. Um, my home, your ELT said that I could potentially walk away with about 88,000 so I could reasonably pay all that off. I could set my son up and myself up in a nice town home or a reasonable town home in a nice area. Good schools. What is your income? Uh, I just got a promotion at my job. I've been there about 10 years. Um, I don't quite know what it works out to me, but it's $21 an hour. I believe it's like 44. Okay. How old are you? I'll be 32 this month, sir. How old's your baby? Eight months. Okay. Okay. Um, I don't know if you need to sell your house or not. You may, that's possible, but that's not your problem today, is it? Yeah. Okay. Do you have family in the area? I do. Um, my mom passed away about two years ago, unfortunately. So, um, I still have my dad and brothers. Oh, you have a father and brothers in the area. Yes. And my grandma, my aunt who would have room for me and Charlie, my son. Okay. Um, you need to get in the car and go to your dad's house when you hang up the phone. I can't do that, sir. I've tried that already. Why can't you do that? Do I need to call the police for you? No, sir. We've already gone through that. Oh, well, I'm about to go through it again. Where are you, Danielle? Are you outside your house right now? Yes, ma'am. Okay. Do you have car keys? Where's Charlie? Where's your, where's your son? In his father's house. In front of my car. All right. You need to, uh, when you hang up, you need to call the police. You need to call your father and you need to get you and your son away from this guy. Do you hear me? Do you understand this is not going to work otherwise, honey. This is not a house problem and it's not a debt problem. You and your son are in danger. Do you understand me? Hello? Yes, sir. Can you hear me? I'm sorry. Where'd you go? Sir, can you hear me? Yeah, I can. Where are you? Okay. I'm sorry. I'm not here. Did you hear what I said or were you distracted? Yes, I did, sir. No, I heard you. Okay. So are you going to sit there in the middle of the sewage or are you going to fix it? I want to fix it. That's why I want this on my home. And I just want to be done. Honey, we don't need to call a realtor. We need to get the boyfriend out of the house and that's going to involve the police and or your father and your brothers. He needs to leave. It's your house. And you're afraid. You understand that this is wrong, right? Yes, sir. Okay. This is, this is, you're, you're not the crazy one. I'm talking to the sane one. No, I'm always trying to do things like that. Yeah, I know. All right. I'll tell you what we're going to do. We're gonna put you on hold and Kelly is going to make sure that law enforcement gets over there. Okay. No, baby doll. I'm not going to be, I'm not, I love you and that baby. Do what? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's okay. It's okay, honey. You're, you're in a, listen, listen, easy, breathe. You're in a horrible situation and you have to make the moves to get away from it. Okay. And part of, part of the type of situation that you are in is that his part of his psychological job is he has convinced you that you're not able to operate without him. And I'm convinced the only way you're ever going to be able to operate is without him. You understand me? Yes, sir. Okay. Listen, you are worth being okay. It's worth being okay for your kid. It's worth being okay. It's your freaking house. He's trespassing. We're going to remove the trespasser. It has to happen. Okay. You have to get away from this guy. Anyone who calls a national radio show and is in this kind of distress tells me that there's serious stuff going on inside your walls. You understand? And then once he's clear, we're going to put you with one of our counselors free. I'm not going to charge you a dime and we're going to walk with you. And then we can start making decisions about your finances. But you don't have a financial problem. You need a boyfriend ectomy and it's happening today, darling. It's happening today. Do you understand? Yes, sir. Today. And Danielle, if you feel like you need you and your son need to be somewhere safe, then I would get out of the house as well. Removing him may not. We're not, you know, after he's gone, you can make this determination with local law enforcement, but you don't get a restraining order. You can do whatever you need to do at that point. But you and the baby need to get out of there until he's gone. And then you need to get someone to remove him. And it's that simple. So, um, that's what you have to do. And then you can begin to have a conversation, uh, in some form of sanity because the situation you are in right now is insane. It's an insane situation. You're not insane, but the situation's crazy girl. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Hey, we love you. You hold on a second. Kelly's going to pick up. Okay. And we're going to make sure you get taken care of.

Good for you. What do you do? I'm a health educator. Cool. Do you have a lot of debt? I actually have no debt except for my mortgage which I only owe $140,000. This is the problem. The millennial, your generation, was the one of the first ones to really really struggle with it. It used to be that we would say don't keep up with the Joneses. Have you ever heard that old saying? Of course. Yeah, but the problem was in those days it wasn't as hard to keep up with the Joneses because they lived next door and you saw them drive in their car but you also saw them have big fight and you also knew that their kids were messed up and you knew this and you knew that so you know when they got a car it wasn't as big a deal because you kind of knew some of the dirt too, right? But on social media your only thing you're looking at is the highlight reel because nobody posts on there how my husband just got me a 1992 Honda. Hashtag blessed. We all can fall prey to this because we're not seeing reality.

A new car loses 60% of its value in the first five years. If you buy a $40,000 car, when you drive it off the lot and you hear that sound going over the curb, boom, boom, when you went into the street, that sound was $10,000. As soon as it's titled to an individual and it touches the street, it's gonna drop 20, 25% that day. That means your $40,000 car in five years is gonna be a $16,000 car.

Created on 2025-01-28 21:29:25+00:00) what's the best way for me to get wealthy? Like, I don't want to say rich, but like wealthy is like the best way. Yeah, it's a big question. It's probably too big for a radio answer. I'll tell you the biggest thing, a couple things. Number one is to be doing what you're doing now, gather knowledge, be very intentional with your money. Most people just kind of wander along and then wonder what happened. And if you'll just be very intentional, then that will lead you to doing a budget. That will lead you to living on less than you make. That will lead you to generosity. That will lead you to avoiding debt. That will lead you to investing. And those are the keys to building wealth. But no one does that accidentally. No one wins the Super Bowl on accident. It's an intentional act. And so just by asking the question, you've started that process of being intentional. So Dave, there's a lot of media sensations that pop up with a couple of college friends come up with an idea and they have an IPO and they turn into overnight this is and that's. Has it been your experience though that the vast majority of people who build, and I love that he already knows the distinction here, that build wealth, it takes a long time, doesn't it? Yeah, get rich quick just does not work, statistically. It's so rare. And the interesting thing is those that do it, very seldom keep it. And so because they didn't build the infrastructure in their character to carry it. And it fritters away. You build the muscles by increment, by struggle after struggle after struggle because a muscle is built by tearing. A muscle is built by destruction, by pain. It is not built by comfort. And so that gradual over a 10, 12, 15 year period of staying out of debt, living on less than you make, being intentional, doing some things that your friends don't do, not doing a bunch of things your friends do do, and that kind of a thing. You have a life, but you're just very smart and wise about it over a period of time. That is how wealth is built. I talked to a young man this morning, 35 years old, came up to me and whispered, he said, I'm an everyday millionaire. And works on our team. Really? Yeah. Walked up to me after a staff meeting, he said, I'm an everyday millionaire, 35. I said, how old are you? He said, 35. I mean, he said, I started working your plan 12 years ago, just out of college. He said, we've always lived exactly what we teach here, to the dime, to the penny, intentional. And he makes good money, but he doesn't, he didn't get paid a million dollars a year, I'll tell you that. He didn't make millionaire money, right? He didn't make millionaire money, but he is. Right. Because he's just that steady, the tortoise wins the race, not the hare. Every time. Yeah. And that's the, you know, all the data we have on millionaires tells us that's how they do it.

And like split everything right down the middle? No. You combine everything there's no middle. The preacher didn't say and now you're a joint venture he said and now you're one. So what if one person makes more than the other like? You're not a partnership you're a marriage. There is no let me give you an example okay? Okay. My my wife has not had an earned income for 30 years she stayed home with our children. I do not have an income. We have an income. It's as much hers as it is mine. Spiritually, morally, and by the way legally. Okay. And so it's it's our income and she and I sit down. Were she to earn an income it would be in the pot put on a pile with mine and I don't get more votes if I make more money. Okay. We both have a vote. We both are going to sit down together. We love each other. We are going to decide about our you're hearing my pronouns here we our not yours mine it's not my car your car. Now we do say that's her car because she drives that car most of the time but she's more than welcome to drive any car we have. I'm more than welcome to drive any car we have. It's not it's not titled exclusively to her name or to my name. It's ours. We own everything. The only thing that is not ours is if the dog poops on the floor that's my dog. But other than that we share it. See if you change your language like that what it forces you to do is it forces you to set goals together instead of having independent goals. Marriages are always growing together or they're growing apart.

Most people are broke. Most people look good and they're broke. They spend more than they have coming in. They don't act their wage. They don't live on a plan. They don't agree on spending with their spouse. Their only hope for retirement is that the government, which is well known for its ability to handle money, will take care of them. They don't have money set aside for emergencies. They run credit card debt and student loans and car debt all day every day. They spend like they're in Congress. Most people are stupid when it comes to money. 70% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. The bankruptcy rate is at an all-time high and foreclosures are rising again. Credit card debt continues to climb and we have a trillion dollars in student loan debt out there. The average car payment in America today now is $496 over 84 months. That's stupid. Normal in America is broke and stupid. You don't want to be normal. You want to be weird. One of the greatest compliments you can get on this show is if you call up and I say, man you're weird. When the culture has lost its way, the best thing you can do is be opposite. Figure out whatever they're doing and do the other thing, right? Because you're not gonna get, you're only gonna get what they're getting when you do what they're doing. This is not hard to figure out. If you keep doing what you've been doing, you're gonna keep getting what you've been getting. You do reap what you sow. You live in a cause and effect world, baby. There's no way around this. So your goal, when I went broke, I realized my goal is to be weird. My goal is to be different. And personal finance is 80% behavior. It's only 20% head knowledge. So this is not some math formula that you've got a problem with. This is a person in your mirror. I figured out if I can make the guy in my mirror behave, he can be skinny and rich. He's got issues. And once we realize that behavior is what causes people to handle their money poorly or handle it well, then what we've got to decide is our behaviors. And if you have the same behaviors as broke people have when it comes to money, you're gonna have the same results broke people have. You're just gonna be another broke person.

The mortgage about 210. So you have six hundred thousand dollars in what? 335 is about in student loans. We both have advanced degrees and then a lot the rest is really credit cards and personal loans. So you have three hundred thousand dollars of credit cards and personal loans? We have about three hundred thirty-five thousand student loans and about a hundred thirty-six thousand in credit cards, forty-four thousand personal loans, and thirty-five thousand car loans. Okay how old are you? I'm 29. Okay so what in the world? So yeah. Are you both on this or is this just one of you that's completely lost your mind? Well I have the majority of the student loans and he has the majority of the credit cards. My credit card debt is about, it's not great. So why does he at 29 years old run up a hundred grand in credit card debt? Well he's 32 but I think it's one of those things where just making really poor financial decisions thinking be able to pay it down as you go and it doesn't it doesn't happen. Okay so you both have advanced degrees. What are your degrees in? We do. So I have a degree in both of our advanced degrees. No he has an MBA and I have an advanced degree in policy. I work in the government and we actually both do now at this point. Okay so your household income is what? Our household income is about $230. Okay. Is there recognition on both of your parts how absurd this situation is? Yes. Okay. Yes there is. So I think we're both a bit scared and want to do anything we can to avoid. Okay great. Then I'm on your team. I can skip that step. Okay good. Okay well you're you're scared and you should be. You're disgusted and you should be. We are. You're early in the early stages of being sick and tired and being sick and tired and you should be. So here's the thing. You guys have been living at across the board from your education choices to your car purchases to your whatever. You've been living at about 10x where you're going to get to live for the next three years. Okay yep that's true. So I'm getting ready to destroy your life as you know it because your life your lifestyle is considerably above your extremely good income and has been for a period of time and so you've gotten used to spending like you're in Congress. Right. This is going to be very emotional for y'all and you're going to have to look at it through that lens and through a spiritual lens or you're not going to make it. You're going to have to not care what anyone thinks including each other because you're not going to spend any money on anything ever for the next three years.

You attack the little one with a vengeance scorched earth lifestyle. Sell so much stuff the kids think they're next. Take 16 extra jobs. We're getting out of debt. And you pay everything. You stop all investing temporarily and completely focus all your emotional, spiritual, financial, relational energy on that smallest debt. Everything goes on that one. When that one's gone, you take the payment that used to be there and any other money we can squeeze out of our budget and we throw it at number two. And when that one's gone, we take the payments from one and two. The snowball rolls over again. It picks up more snow and you attack number three. The average person for the past 25 years that has done that with great focused intensity, gone crazy to the point their broke friends and relatives thought they needed counseling. They shaved their head. They drank the Kool-Aid. They get out of debt in about 18 to 24 months. Everything but their house.

Created on 2023-02-23 18:11:43+00:00) If you are behind on your payments, how do you do a budget? You have to prioritize your dollars. And that means we're going to take care of what we used to learn, and they no longer teach it in the 8th grade, called civics. The difference in necessities and luxuries, food. There's one. No, eating out is not a necessity. Some of you people, all you know how to make is reservations. And you gotta work on that, okay? So food at home, cheap, that you bought at the grocery store, with a coupon. Food is a necessity. Utilities, lights and water, so you have heat. Once you've gotten food and utilities, we're bellies full and we're warm, number three is shelter. So you take care of your place to live, so you're not homeless, you pay your rent. Now almost everyone can scratch around and make enough money to buy their food, keep their electricity current, if they're first, second and third, and keep your rent paid. And if you'll just get real calm, cool and collected and go, we're going to eat before we do anything, not eat out. We're going to pay the utilities, not cable, before we do anything. We're going to pay rent. And when you do those three things, you got a lot of money, most of you, left over after those three things. The next one's transportation. And until you clear food, utilities, housing and transportation and get them all current, you don't spend anything else on anything. Food, shelter, transportation and utilities, get current on them before you worry about anything else. Everyone else can jump in the creek until that's done.

The 401k itself is not an investment. It is how the investment is treated under section 401k or section 401 subsection K of the IRS code, meaning that you're allowed to have money taken out of your check and put into an investment pre-tax and then it grows tax free if it's a Roth 401k tax deferred if it's a regular 401k. Now, what's been underperforming is not the actual 401k. It's more like the coat that is keeping the investment warm. It's the investment inside the coat that sucked. If you had an underperforming 401k, what you really had was an underperforming investment in your 401k. Does that make sense? Sort of, and what do you mean by that? Okay, pretend like there's a cookie jar and that's the investment with the cookies. The cookies in the cookie jar are either good or bad. The jar doesn't determine that. The jar is just where you park the cookies. That make sense? Yes. You could have peanut butter cookies, you could have sugar cookies, you could have chocolate chip cookies and they could be good cookies or they could suck, but the jar didn't cause any of that to happen. The jar's just where you have them. The 401k is the jar, the investment is the cookies. So we basically, at the three places I've worked at, they didn't really have the right investment. Or you didn't pick the right ones from the ones that they offered. Right, there was four on each one of them. No, there was four general portfolios on each one of them and you picked the wrong portfolio, but you probably could have gone even inside of those four portfolios, meaning they had a low risk, a medium risk, and a high risk or something like that. And that high risk would have had a group of mutual funds in it that would have sounded a lot like what we tell you to do and you would have done a lot better had you been in that versus the one you were in. And so what you're looking for is you're looking for mutual funds inside the 401k, whether there's a match or not. A match is helpful, obviously, because it's freaking free money. But you're looking for mutual funds inside the 401k that have a good long-term track record. And I personally, in my 401k here at my business, do this and I recommend that other people do the same thing, that you put it in four types of mutual funds. Growth, growth and income, aggressive growth, and international. And that's the cookies, okay? You summon a chocolate chip cookie, you want some peanut butter cookie, you want some sugar cookie and so on, right? Some Oreos or whatever, I'm just making this up as I go here. But the bottom line is that you're trying to get different kinds of investments that have good long-term track records and they fall under the heading of growth stock mutual funds inside the 401k. You can also do that inside a Roth. And if you don't like the options that your company has available to you to invest inside the 401k and there's no match, then you could go to just a Roth IRA, do the exact same thing and pick from any of 8,000 mutual funds. So certainly you could get a good one that way.

Whatever happened in the past, yeah, we'll glance back there and make sure we don't do it again and run over somebody else. But right here, this is all options in front of us, right? Listen, mistakes don't define you, they refine you. You screwed up this morning, so what? Start again, right now. Take another step. If you keep taking a step, you can get anywhere, guys. The trick is just don't quit, right?

Created on 2025-02-13 20:27:24+00:00) are newlyweds. We've been married for six months and now we are looking at combining our finances, but he is a little bit nervous. Together we have a total of $137,000 in student loans, where mine is over $111,000 and his is a lot less. Did he know this when you got married? Yes sir, he did. Did he say the vows at the altar that said for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, unto thee all my worldly goods I pledge? Yes sir, he did. Did he mean it? I hope so. Then why are your finances not combined? Because he's nervous about my family and how I handle my finances with them. You give your family money without talking to your husband? Well, before we got married I used to live with my parents, so I pay for half of the mortgage and I pay for other bills. Still? And still, yes. After you got married, you pay half the mortgage for somebody else when you have $111,000 in student loan debt? Yes sir. Why? Because my parents are in their 80s and they don't work. Do they not have Social Security? We're not from this country, so no sir. Okay. Did your husband know that you were obligated to take care of your 80 year old parents when you got married? He did, but he also would like some help from my siblings and that's one part where I'm nervous to talk to my siblings about it. I'm not. It's overdue. I agree with your husband. He would like to combine our finances, but because of the situation that I'm in, he doesn't know how to go about doing that. Yeah. Well, the way he would go about it is is that the two of you come into agreement on what you are willing to do to support your parents. When you lived there, it was perfectly logical that you took care of half the mortgage because you were a roommate with them. Now that you don't live there anymore and you have your own household, it now becomes a charitable act to aging parents that you take care of the mortgage, which should be shared with siblings. I agree with him. Yes sir. Yesterday, like before you got married, this should have been talked about to your siblings. I'm moving out and we're all taking care of mom and dad split-seas. Yes sir. That's where I have to start doing that. Yeah, and I think you know you agree to do that. So you think your siblings aren't going to want to take care of your parents? I'm sure that they would if they could, but all of them. I don't come from a financially stable household. We were never taught how to save or do any of that. So everyone is working paycheck to paycheck. Gotcha. And how much does it take to support your mom and dad? It would be about $2,000 U.S. Are they in the U.S.? Yes. Okay, per month. My siblings, most of them are not. Okay, $2,000 U.S. per month. Yes, that's covering... And what is your household income, you and your new husband? Our household income after tax is $80,976. Okay, so you're making about $102,000, $103,000 right? Yes sir. Okay, well that's pretty good news. And your siblings, how many of them are there? I have seven in total. Okay, well here's what it sounds like if I'm at your house. You guys have to talk this through, okay? We can't put your parents in the street. No. That is not an option. No. Okay, what do your parents have? Any income or any assets? Not in the U.S. Okay, what income and assets do they have outside the U.S.? If they went back home, they have their own property and they don't have much expenses there. Right, and so where is home? Belize, Central America. Okay, and what is that property worth were they to sell it? Probably about $60,000 U.S. And that would take care of about 30 months? Yes, but I have one brother living there, so we can't sell that one. Oh, we can sell it. He can move and rent. It's not his property. This is so... I mean, listen, I understand taking care of your parents and I want you to be doing that. I don't want to put old people in the street. That is not my heart, but I agree with your husband that there's a toxic thing going on here and the only one that's getting ridden is you. Yeah. Nobody else is doing what they're supposed to do in this whole story. Your parents aren't selling their property. Your brothers and sisters aren't chipping in what they can chip in. Now, if I were your husband, I would say, listen, I am fine helping to support them as long as everybody puts in something. Not necessarily equal, because I understand they're in a different country. They don't necessarily have the income, but everybody puts in something. I don't care if it's $50. Everybody puts in something, and the property back home is being sold. Yes, sir. Let's pretend you were broke. What would they do? We don't have to pretend. No, I mean, that's true, because you got $111,000 in student loan debt, but I'm saying, let's pretend you didn't have any options here to participate. What would happen to mom and dad? They would sell the property back home to keep from being in the street, or they'd move back home and live in that property. One of the two, wouldn't they? Yes. Ta-da. Okay, and once we combine our finances and get that out, what would be your best advice for us to tackle this huge loan that we have? Head on as fast as you can, living on nothing. It's going to be somewhat slowed by the money you use to help take care of your parents, and I suggest to your husband that he agree to something where you do participate in taking care of your parents if the property is sold and the other siblings participate at some level, but if they're all going to leave it all on you, I'm going to leave it all on them and let them figure it out, because I think they're being stubborn and milking you like you're a cow. I think everybody's got a place to play here, and nobody's playing but you. So if I'm your husband, I would have to be willing to take care of your mom and dad, but not when no one else is participating.

Created on 2025-02-13 17:39:40+00:00) If people aren't making fun of you, you're probably not on track. Because people are stupid. People are broke. Because if you look around, 70% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. You want to be that? I don't want to be that. When I hit bottom, I mean, I didn't hit bottom, I completely splatted. I know what stupid looks like. I looked that boy in the mirror. I know who he is. And so you don't want to live like that. But your foundational stuff is to at least get rid of your debt, not counting your home. And at least get you a rainy day fund. You have to look in the mirror and look at each other as a married couple or as a single. Look in the mirror and say, no, we're not going on vacation. We're broke. We have two car payments and a credit card loan, credit card debt and a student loan that's been around so long we think it's a pet. No, we're not going to strut around acting like we're something we're not. It's time to lay these basic steps out and lay into them and say, that's it. I'm tired of being broke. I worked too stinking hard to be this broke.

Created on 2025-02-12 17:27:10+00:00) Baby step one is $1,000 saved. Two is pay off all your debts except your home using the debt snowball where you list your debts, smallest to largest, and pay them off in that order with great focused intensity. Once you're out of debt, then you go back to the $1,000 account in baby step three and raise it up to a fully funded emergency fund of three to six months of expenses. You need to run like your hair's on fire until you get those three steps done. You need to be in a panic until you get those three steps done. Just think about your life right now. How would that feel? No payments, but a house payment and 15 or 20,000 or $10,000 laying there. You're not even there yet and you just started breathing better. Just thinking about it. But until you get there, you're just scrapping and clawing like a rat in a wheel, man. And so you have to break the cycle. You've got to get so fired up and wired up that your broke friends think you've lost your mind.

Created on 2025-02-11 21:22:13+00:00) I was studying at West Point, and when I went abroad my senior year, I acted a fool and got myself kicked out right before I graduated, so now I owe the government about $300,000. And while I was there, I also took out a personal loan of about $35,000. I recently got married in May, and my wife, she can't work right now because we're waiting on her green card. I bounced around a few jobs since then, and the one I'm working on now is on a bad job, but I'm not particularly passionate about it. And I'm actually on my way now to do my orientation for Domino's. I'm going to go deliver pizzas as a side job, but I don't really know what to do. I had my career path to be in the Army, and I thought I was going to figure it out then, but right now I'm just, I don't know, I feel like I'm working, and to pay off all those debts is going to take me a long time, I feel like. Yeah, how old are you? 24. So you are how close to graduating from West Point? The day before, they told me I was getting separated. Oh man, I'm so sorry. What a disaster. Yeah, well, I mean, I'm the one that misbehaved, but I take responsibility for that. I understand. It's a tough situation. Yeah, you did it, but what a mess. The, so I am not positive, I mean, obviously that is the preeminent military war college. Do those college credits transfer to another college? Yes, yes, I actually transferred them and was able to get my degree last month. Okay, that's good news. In what? I got one of those stupid majors you talk about, because I plan on being in the Army, but it's in Russian studies. Okay, but that was the closest thing for you to finish. Yes, sir, I ended up finishing up with the same degree I was studying at West Point. Right, okay, but at least you come out with a degree. Okay. All right. Oh my goodness. Well, I think, you know, what I'm going to do, what drew you to Russian studies while you're in the military? What was your, obviously you were studying it from a military aspect, is that right? Right, and I just fell in love with the language. I was originally a math and econ major, but I wanted to go abroad and learn the language and then hopefully get a job in the government agency after. Yeah, okay, here's what I want you to do. I want you to pursue international business with a specialization in Russia, and I want you to learn how to do trade and how to do deals, because you've got these skills. You've got a natural tendency to business with econ and math. You've got the skill set to do that, and you've got this very specialized set of skills, understanding the Russian culture, language, and so forth, agreed? Yes, sir. Yeah, I think that translates to international business, and there is a lot of money flowing in and out of Russia, legal money, not illegal money, as you probably already know, and so, I would lean into that and say that's going to be the salvation of this mess, because you've got a really, really big hole here, and delivering Domino's pizza is not going to get you out of 300 grand. Well, that's my side job. Okay, and your day job is what? I work in a rubber factory. Okay, now making what? I make about $15 an hour, so it's about 30 grand a year. Okay, well, I want you to forgive yourself for your stupidity and reset your career, and go, okay, I'm 24, I did a really dumb thing, it's now in the rearview mirror, I'm not a $15 an hour guy, I'm a $100,000 a year guy, and I'm going to go about becoming a specialist in Russian international business, and I'm going to find a job, and I'm going to find people that work with people in Russia, businesses that interact with that, and I'm going to go work for them, and I'm going to make some serious money to get out of this mess. Even if you didn't have this mess, that would be what you would need to do, because you've got that potential, and I don't want you to take a $15 an hour job, and that is now your future in a factory, because you had, right on the cusp of graduating from one of the world's finest institutions, you did something stupid. That does not need to define your life. It just needs to cause your life to be redirected. Is that okay? Yeah, I think my biggest thing is just not really, you know, my purpose was to serve in the Army, and now, since then, I've just kind of been wandering about. Yep, and it's time to get a new one, brother. Not having a purpose sucks, doesn't it? I'm sitting here trying to give you a new one, because, listen, other than the dumb thing you did, you don't get to the final cut, the final day at West Point, if you're stupid. You're not an ignorant, you're not an unintelligent person, okay? You don't get there. It's not possible. It's too tough. Am I wrong? You're right. Okay, you did a dumb thing. That doesn't make you unintelligent, it makes you a smart guy who did a dumb thing. I can, you put my name on that list, I'm a smart guy who's done a lot of dumb things in my life. So, put it in the rearview mirror, and let's reset our purpose. We're not going that way. Okay, where are we going? There's got to be a different adventure, and it doesn't mean that you are doomed to a life of slavery. Next time I talk to you, I want a little more hope in your voice, a little more energy in your voice, and I want you fired up and wired up about where you're going, because that's the next step in your life, brother, and you're not getting out of this debt with Domino's Pizza and $15. Besides that, it'd be a waste of your life. You're too sharp. There's too much good you can still do, and you can have some fun with the skill set you've got, and you may even be able to get involved in policy and some other stuff in the government position. You don't have to graduate from West Point to use your skill set in a think tank in D.C. somewhere. So, don't camp on the backside of the desert here too long, my brother. You've got stuff to do.

Created on 2025-02-11 17:03:12+00:00) God want me or us to be wealthy? Here's the true idea, okay? God doesn't care if you're wealthy or if you're poor. He doesn't care, one way or the other. All He wants is your heart. All He wants is your worship. And if poverty gets in the way of your worship, that's a problem. If wealth gets in the way of your worship, that's a problem. Those of us that are people of faith, that are people of the book, believe that we don't own anything. We are merely managing it for God. There's all this biblical evidence that we're not supposed to worship wealth and that wealth can be dangerous because it can become an idol. But if we can maintain the distance from it as a manager instead of an owner, if you don't say my my my my my, instead you go, I'm holding this with an open hand, what do you want me to do with it? It's yours. And then you're managing it. If you're faithful with the little things, you'll be given more to manage. But on the other hand, you're not better than someone else. I know some of the highest character, smartest people who are not wealthy. And that does, you know, you're not better than them if you're managing more money than they're managing. You just have more responsibility.

Created on 2025-02-10 15:05:47+00:00) If you agreed on four things prior to marriage, you have a very high statistical probability of staying married. Money. How we handle it. How we view it. Kids. Are we going to have them? How many? How are we going to treat them? The crazy people in our family called in-laws. Everybody's got it. So how are we going to handle that? How are we going to handle the extended crazy and are we going to stand beside each other in that? And it's religion. Agreement on religion. And so if you're in agreement on those four things, you have a very high probability.

Created on 2025-02-08 19:27:45+00:00) You want to win with money? Let me give you a good idea. Figure out what most people are doing and run in the other direction. Run in the other direction. Most people are broke. Most people look good and they're broke. They spend more than they have coming in. They don't act their wage. They don't live on a plan. They don't agree on spending with their spouse. Their only hope for retirement is that the government, which is well known for its ability to handle money, will take care of them. They don't have money set aside for emergencies. They run credit card debt and student loans and card debt all day, every day. They spend like they're in Congress. Most people are stupid when it comes to money. 70% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. The bankruptcy rate is at an all time high and foreclosures are rising again. Credit card debt continues to climb and we have a trillion dollars in student loan debt out there. The average car payment in America today now is $496 over 84 months. That's stupid. Normal in America is broke and stupid. You don't want to be normal. You want to be weird. One of the greatest compliments you can get on this show is if you call up and I say, man, you're weird. I'm looking at weird people. You guys are weird, which means that you're contrary. You are a contrarian. You are perpendicular to the culture. When the culture has lost its way, the best thing you can do is be opposite. Figure out whatever they're doing and do the other thing, right? Because you're not going to get, you're only going to get what they're getting when you do what they're doing. This is not hard to figure out. If you keep doing what you've been doing, you're going to keep getting what you've been getting. You do reap what you sow. You live in a cause a cause and effect world, baby. There's no way around this. So your goal, when I went broke, I realized my goal is to be weird. My goal is to be different. And personal finance is 80% behavior. It's only 20% head knowledge. So this is not some math formula that you've got a problem with. This is a person in your mirror. I figured out if I can make the guy in my mirror behave, he can be skinny and rich. He's got issues. And once we realize that behavior is what causes people to handle their money poorly or handle it well, then what we've got to decide is our behavior. And if you have the same behaviors as broke people have in, when it comes to money, you're going to have the same, you're going to have the same results. Broke people have, you're just going to be another broke person. And some of you are making $250,000 a year and you're broke. You had no money at all. You got a mess loans coming out your ears. You can't breathe. You run, run, run, run, run, run, run. Run, run, run, run. Like a rat in a wheel, have a heart attack and die and wonder what happened. This is no way to live. Buying things you can't afford with money. You don't have to impress people. You don't really like some of you spend an unbelievable amount of money on a car payment to impress somebody at a stoplight. You will never be introduced to the buddy. You felt cool there for about what? Three and a half seconds. Fool. I've been that fool. That's why I know who he is. I've been that guy. I've been that shallow where I thought that my car actually mattered to somebody. Give me a break. Nobody gives a rip about your car. It, listen, if, if you know what I drive right now, anything I want, you know why? Cause I drove crap for a long time. I drove cars like nobody else would drive. Now I get to drive whatever I want to drive. And I don't drive them for you. I drive them because I like them. I couldn't give a careless what you think about what I drive. It's not my problem. It's not your problem either. By the way, I'm going to enjoy, I'm a boy. I like nice cars. I'm going to get, but I'm not going to have a nice car with a stupid car payment on it. It's ridiculous. If your self-esteem is so screwed up that you're doing that, then you're going to struggle with money. You're normal. People spending a bunch of money to act like there's something they're not what they call in Texas, big hat, no cattle. You need to decide. I don't care what other people think. And I'm going to be weird, whatever you're doing with money. I'm going to do the opposite thing. And when you decide that you'll start winning with money. I don't have any credit cards, not a single one. No, I don't believe in points. I've never met a millionaire. So Dave, you know, I made all my money with my airline miles. No stupid people. Don't say that in the real world. I meet middle-class people who spend everything on a credit card because they're racking up points. Not figure this math out for me. You get 1% back on your stupid discover card, right? Have you ever discovered what the math is on that discover card? That means if you spend $100,000, you get $1,000. Is this a path to wealth anywhere? You went to math class. That's just straight up stupid. I mean, in the sixth grade, you should have been able to figure the fourth grade. Third grade. You should have been able to figure that one out that that's not going to work. I mean, you run a hundred grand through a stupid credit card to get a free airline ticket. Give me a break. With what you overspent, you could have bought 10 airline tickets and all in the name of I'm racking up points. I'm beating. You're not beating anybody. They're a multibillion dollar company. They've got done so many behavior studies on you based on your zip code and your demographic. They know what kind of bottled water you drink, fool. They're tracking you. Every movement you make on the web is being followed with web analytics. They know exactly what you're doing. No, this is not a conspiracy theory. They are better at marketing than you are at living your life. And they're selling you so much crap. You're broke. And you're playing their game. You're playing Citibank's game. What's in your wallet? I'll tell you what's in my wallet. Money. That's what's in my wallet. It's not a bunch of stupid plastic. So I'm weird. Dave, you're weird. You're right. I'm not broke. Normal's broke. I don't want to be normal. I engage in weird activities. And so I get weird results. And that's called money. I'm not broke anymore because I do things that broke people don't do. And I don't do things that the broke people do do. Why is this hard? You want to be skinny? Find out what skinny people eat. Eat what they eat. You'll be skinny. You want to be fat? Eat what fat people eat. You will be fat. This is not rocket science, people. Figure it out. You want a great marriage? Well, don't ask somebody who's been divorced six times. We'll pray for them. But I don't need their marriage advice. They ain't got this thing figured out, baby. I want to find somebody that's winning and emulate them. This is not rocket science. Be weird. That's your goal, darling. Be weird. Weird, weird, weird, weird.

Right, because if you have 20 people, well, that's exactly... You distribute the problem of your own sanity. I thought that was marriage. That's right. Well, that's what marriage... Marriage... In a huge part, the advantage of marriage is that, is that, you know, your wife taps you back into position and vice versa. If you're going to be sane, you have to be acceptable to, valued by, and in constant contact with a social group. And then you need to, if you're wise, select your social group carefully. I mean, this is why there were businessmen organizations like the Rotary and the Kinsmen and so forth. And, you know, we see their membership plummeting in recent years. But it was there because people were wise enough to understand that even if you had attained things, you know, on your own as a solitary venture, an entrepreneur, that it was extremely useful to have a community around you. It's not good that men be alone. No, no, no. You, you...

I feel like I really want to spend time raising our little one. Cool. What a great goal. So does he make enough money for you to live on? Yeah, like he makes about $975,000. What's that mean? $975,000. $975,000 a year? Yeah. Okay, I think you could probably freaking struggle through. It's not so much the finances as it is, I think he has a worry that I'll never go back to work. So? Like, I don't know. I think because his mom works like three jobs. So? I know. He makes $975,000. Okay, here's the deal. Sharon Ramsey went home to be a full-time mom when our first daughter was born 34 years ago. Yeah. She has never worked in the workplace since. She is engaged in a lot of ministry boards. She sits on hospital boards. She is engaged in being a full-time Mimi to six grandbabies. She raised three wonderful children. I call that an incredible career. I do too. Okay. I just don't know how to get my husband on the same page. Why does he go do all of that if it's not so that your family can do what they want to do? I know. Like, I just don't see the point in paying like a nanny or daycare. So if you want to be outside the home and have a career and that's your aspiration and you want to do that, then no shame on that either. Absolutely. But but this idea that somehow motherhood is full-time motherhood is not a is somehow to be shamed or to be looked down upon is absolute BS. Moms can't win because if they work they're guilty and if they don't work they're guilty. Mm-hmm. I know. It's like guilt is built into the whole program or something. I don't know what it is. What's a boy child do for a living? We've been together about seven. She's an investment advisor. I guess he is. I'm the writer. Okay. It's so impressive. He's doing so well. I don't know. I think that number one, I just want to give you encouragement and say, A, this is not crazy. It's not irresponsible. As a matter of fact, it is a high dignity position. I mean, this is a high calling and it has dignity, it has value, it has worth equivalent to anything you could do in the workplace. No shame, no guilt, and should be no hesitation financially or economically.

Created on 2025-02-05 16:59:08+00:00) I personally invest in good growth stock mutual funds. I spread it across four types, growth and income, growth, aggressive growth, and international. And I buy mutual funds that have at least a 10-year track record. Let's talk about those for a second because there's all kinds of names for mutual funds. And the name of the mutual fund tells you what is in the fund, OK? A growth and income fund is also called a large cap fund, or sometimes also called a blue chip fund. Now, the blue chip is the most expensive chip on the poker table. So that means these are big companies in this. Large cap is short for large capitalization. Large capitalization means these are large companies. And so your growth and income funds are large companies, boring. Of the four types of mutual funds that I put money into, and I recommend, this is the calmest. If you were to chart this volatility on this fund versus the stock market, you would see it's a lot calmer than the market. And so it's your friend when things are going down, in other words. It's your stable. It's the big old dinosaur companies. They're boring. When things are going up, by the way, it's also boring. It's not exciting when things are going up. It's a downer. You look at that thing going, why is it not doing well when the rest of the market's going up? Because it goes slower than the market up and slower than the market down, because it's a stable land. Stable land. A growth fund is right in the middle. The S&P 500 index fund would be considered a growth fund. A growth fund is companies that are growing. They're kind of medium-sized companies. So you might hear it called mid-cap fund. And so these are just standard growth stock mutual funds. There's a whole lot of these out there. Ton of funds that fall in this area. So the idea is pretty simple. The growth fund, that's kind of right there in the middle. You want something in the middle. It's pretty much going to do about what the market does in terms of volatility, but you can get mutual funds that are growth stock mutual funds that outperform the S&P 500. You can even get growth and income funds, even though they're not as volatile, that outperform the S&P 500. Then there's the aggressive growth fund. This is the wild brother, okay? It's the crazy one. And so you might guess it's going to be also called a small-cap funds. These are the small companies, the startups. A lot of tech companies would fall into there. Very crazy. All the fun, weird stuff is in there. And that means some of it fails and goes to zero. And so it's a crazier mix. It's going to be much more volatile than the stock market is. So it's going to go up faster than the market goes up, but it's going to go down faster than the market goes down. Small-cap aggressive growth stock mutual funds. Also known in there as, let's see, small-cap aggressive growth. Oh, emerging market. You would call it that too as well. International funds means that the stocks in it are our overseas companies. They're not American companies. It has a kissing cousin called a global fund. If you think of a globe, what is it? It's everything. So that would have international and US companies in a global fund. And it would be a cousin to an international. By the way, American companies generally outperform other international companies by and large as a group. And so your international fund will be your worst performing of the four over the last several decades. And a global fund will outperform an international fund because you put some spice in there. You put some American companies in there usually. And so they're a little bit better, but at least you got some stuff overseas. You're not 100% betting on the American economy. Not that I'm anti-American. I am not. This is not a patriotic thing. This is a diversification thing. And so you want to have some BMW and some Mercedes in there. You want to have some LG and some other stuff. Even though some of those things are made stateside, those are foreign companies. And so you look for companies that are overseas based, could be a French company, could be whatever, and that are in an international fund. And then you spread your investing across those four types. You know, very simple here. Very simple. The thing is, do it. That's the thing. Everybody talks and talks and talks and talks and talks about investing. The problem is nobody does it. The people we talked to on the Millionaire Theme Hour that are millionaires, you know how they got to be millionaires? They did it.

Because your most powerful wealth-building tool is your income. And when you haven't committed your income in the form of payments to everybody else, you can invest it and become wealthy. Really. The average car payment in America today is $503. That's just cray-cray. That's nutty. If you invest $500 in a decent growth stock mutual fund from age 30 to age 70, you'll have over $5 million. That one thing will make you worth $5 million. Getting out of the land to car payments, just staying out of them. Isn't that amazing? And so I've become known for getting people out of debt, and the only reason I get people out of debt is because it increases their generosity and increases their ability to invest and become wealthy, which also increases their generosity. And it changes your life. It changes your family tree. It changes your retirement. You retire with dignity. You don't have to buy that cookbook, 72 Ways to Prepare Alpo, and love it. You can retire with dignity. But you have to do it on purpose. And getting out of debt in order to invest is the shortest way.

I'm just really torn because I love my home and I love my neighborhood, but I just want to be able to pay my debt off and provide better for my son. Okay. Uh, so you own the home with your boyfriend or? No, sir. It's just me. You own it. Yeah. Okay. Um, when is he leaving? Uh, that's a great question. Well, I'll give you the answer tonight. I can hear it. No, no. I can hear it in your voice. You sound really afraid to me. Yeah. Well, I'm trying to talk to you outside and he's actually standing next to me cause she can't go inside. Okay. Um, I have about $16,000 worth of debt. Um, and it includes a car credit card, the medical debt from the birth of our son that I get no help with. Yeah. Um, my home, your ELT said that I could potentially walk away with about 88,000 so I could reasonably pay all that off. I could set my son up and myself up in a nice town home or a reasonable town home in a nice area. Good schools. What is your income? Uh, I just got a promotion at my job. I've been there about 10 years. Um, I don't quite know what it works out to me, but it's $21 an hour. I believe it's like 44. Okay. How old are you? I'll be 32 this month, sir. How old's your baby? Eight months. Okay. Okay. Um, I don't know if you need to sell your house or not. You may, that's possible, but that's not your problem today, is it? Yeah. Okay. Do you have family in the area? I do. Um, my mom passed away about two years ago, unfortunately. So, um, I still have my dad and brothers. Oh, you have a father and brothers in the area. Yes. And my grandma, my aunt who would have room for me and Charlie, my son. Okay. Um, you need to get in the car and go to your dad's house when you hang up the phone. I can't do that, sir. I've tried that already. Why can't you do that? Do I need to call the police for you? No, sir. We've already gone through that. Oh, well, I'm about to go through it again. Where are you, Danielle? Are you outside your house right now? Yes, ma'am. Okay. Do you have car keys? Where's Charlie? Where's your, where's your son? In his father's house. In front of my car. All right. You need to, uh, when you hang up, you need to call the police. You need to call your father and you need to get you and your son away from this guy. Do you hear me? Do you understand this is not going to work otherwise, honey. This is not a house problem and it's not a debt problem. You and your son are in danger. Do you understand me? Hello? Yes, sir. Can you hear me? I'm sorry. Where'd you go? Sir, can you hear me? Yeah, I can. Where are you? Okay. I'm sorry. I'm not here. Did you hear what I said or were you distracted? Yes, I did, sir. No, I heard you. Okay. So are you going to sit there in the middle of the sewage or are you going to fix it? I want to fix it. That's why I want this on my home. And I just want to be done. Honey, we don't need to call a realtor. We need to get the boyfriend out of the house and that's going to involve the police and or your father and your brothers. He needs to leave. It's your house. And you're afraid. You understand that this is wrong, right? Yes, sir. Okay. This is, this is, you're, you're not the crazy one. I'm talking to the sane one. No, I'm always trying to do things like that. Yeah, I know. All right. I'll tell you what we're going to do. We're gonna put you on hold and Kelly is going to make sure that law enforcement gets over there. Okay. No, baby doll. I'm not going to be, I'm not, I love you and that baby. Do what? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's okay. It's okay, honey. You're, you're in a, listen, listen, easy, breathe. You're in a horrible situation and you have to make the moves to get away from it. Okay. And part of, part of the type of situation that you are in is that his part of his psychological job is he has convinced you that you're not able to operate without him. And I'm convinced the only way you're ever going to be able to operate is without him. You understand me? Yes, sir. Okay. Listen, you are worth being okay. It's worth being okay for your kid. It's worth being okay. It's your freaking house. He's trespassing. We're going to remove the trespasser. It has to happen. Okay. You have to get away from this guy. Anyone who calls a national radio show and is in this kind of distress tells me that there's serious stuff going on inside your walls. You understand? And then once he's clear, we're going to put you with one of our counselors free. I'm not going to charge you a dime and we're going to walk with you. And then we can start making decisions about your finances. But you don't have a financial problem. You need a boyfriend ectomy and it's happening today, darling. It's happening today. Do you understand? Yes, sir. Today. And Danielle, if you feel like you need you and your son need to be somewhere safe, then I would get out of the house as well. Removing him may not. We're not, you know, after he's gone, you can make this determination with local law enforcement, but you don't get a restraining order. You can do whatever you need to do at that point. But you and the baby need to get out of there until he's gone. And then you need to get someone to remove him. And it's that simple. So, um, that's what you have to do. And then you can begin to have a conversation, uh, in some form of sanity because the situation you are in right now is insane. It's an insane situation. You're not insane, but the situation's crazy girl. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Hey, we love you. You hold on a second. Kelly's going to pick up. Okay. And we're going to make sure you get taken care of.

Good for you. What do you do? I'm a health educator. Cool. Do you have a lot of debt? I actually have no debt except for my mortgage which I only owe $140,000. This is the problem. The millennial, your generation, was the one of the first ones to really really struggle with it. It used to be that we would say don't keep up with the Joneses. Have you ever heard that old saying? Of course. Yeah, but the problem was in those days it wasn't as hard to keep up with the Joneses because they lived next door and you saw them drive in their car but you also saw them have big fight and you also knew that their kids were messed up and you knew this and you knew that so you know when they got a car it wasn't as big a deal because you kind of knew some of the dirt too, right? But on social media your only thing you're looking at is the highlight reel because nobody posts on there how my husband just got me a 1992 Honda. Hashtag blessed. We all can fall prey to this because we're not seeing reality.

A new car loses 60% of its value in the first five years. If you buy a $40,000 car, when you drive it off the lot and you hear that sound going over the curb, boom, boom, when you went into the street, that sound was $10,000. As soon as it's titled to an individual and it touches the street, it's gonna drop 20, 25% that day. That means your $40,000 car in five years is gonna be a $16,000 car.

Created on 2025-01-28 21:29:25+00:00) what's the best way for me to get wealthy? Like, I don't want to say rich, but like wealthy is like the best way. Yeah, it's a big question. It's probably too big for a radio answer. I'll tell you the biggest thing, a couple things. Number one is to be doing what you're doing now, gather knowledge, be very intentional with your money. Most people just kind of wander along and then wonder what happened. And if you'll just be very intentional, then that will lead you to doing a budget. That will lead you to living on less than you make. That will lead you to generosity. That will lead you to avoiding debt. That will lead you to investing. And those are the keys to building wealth. But no one does that accidentally. No one wins the Super Bowl on accident. It's an intentional act. And so just by asking the question, you've started that process of being intentional. So Dave, there's a lot of media sensations that pop up with a couple of college friends come up with an idea and they have an IPO and they turn into overnight this is and that's. Has it been your experience though that the vast majority of people who build, and I love that he already knows the distinction here, that build wealth, it takes a long time, doesn't it? Yeah, get rich quick just does not work, statistically. It's so rare. And the interesting thing is those that do it, very seldom keep it. And so because they didn't build the infrastructure in their character to carry it. And it fritters away. You build the muscles by increment, by struggle after struggle after struggle because a muscle is built by tearing. A muscle is built by destruction, by pain. It is not built by comfort. And so that gradual over a 10, 12, 15 year period of staying out of debt, living on less than you make, being intentional, doing some things that your friends don't do, not doing a bunch of things your friends do do, and that kind of a thing. You have a life, but you're just very smart and wise about it over a period of time. That is how wealth is built. I talked to a young man this morning, 35 years old, came up to me and whispered, he said, I'm an everyday millionaire. And works on our team. Really? Yeah. Walked up to me after a staff meeting, he said, I'm an everyday millionaire, 35. I said, how old are you? He said, 35. I mean, he said, I started working your plan 12 years ago, just out of college. He said, we've always lived exactly what we teach here, to the dime, to the penny, intentional. And he makes good money, but he doesn't, he didn't get paid a million dollars a year, I'll tell you that. He didn't make millionaire money, right? He didn't make millionaire money, but he is. Right. Because he's just that steady, the tortoise wins the race, not the hare. Every time. Yeah. And that's the, you know, all the data we have on millionaires tells us that's how they do it.

And like split everything right down the middle? No. You combine everything there's no middle. The preacher didn't say and now you're a joint venture he said and now you're one. So what if one person makes more than the other like? You're not a partnership you're a marriage. There is no let me give you an example okay? Okay. My my wife has not had an earned income for 30 years she stayed home with our children. I do not have an income. We have an income. It's as much hers as it is mine. Spiritually, morally, and by the way legally. Okay. And so it's it's our income and she and I sit down. Were she to earn an income it would be in the pot put on a pile with mine and I don't get more votes if I make more money. Okay. We both have a vote. We both are going to sit down together. We love each other. We are going to decide about our you're hearing my pronouns here we our not yours mine it's not my car your car. Now we do say that's her car because she drives that car most of the time but she's more than welcome to drive any car we have. I'm more than welcome to drive any car we have. It's not it's not titled exclusively to her name or to my name. It's ours. We own everything. The only thing that is not ours is if the dog poops on the floor that's my dog. But other than that we share it. See if you change your language like that what it forces you to do is it forces you to set goals together instead of having independent goals. Marriages are always growing together or they're growing apart.

Created on 2025-01-27 20:11:55+00:00) want to win with money, let me give you a good idea. Figure out what most people are doing and run in the other direction. Run in the other direction. Most people are broke. Most people look good and they're broke. They spend more than they have coming in. They don't act their wage. They don't live on a plan. They don't agree on spending with their spouse. Their only hope for retirement is that the government, which is well known for its ability to handle money, will take care of them. They don't have money set aside for emergencies. They run credit card debt and student loans and car debt all day every day. They spend like they're in Congress. Most people are stupid when it comes to money. 70% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. The bankruptcy rate is at an all-time high and foreclosures are rising again. Credit card debt continues to climb and we have a trillion dollars in student loan debt out there. The average car payment in America today now is $496 over 84 months. That's stupid. Normal in America is broke and stupid. You don't want to be normal. You want to be weird. One of the greatest compliments you can get on this show is if you call up and I say, man you're weird. When the culture has lost its way, the best thing you can do is be opposite. Figure out whatever they're doing and do the other thing, right? Because you're not gonna get, you're only gonna get what they're getting when you do what they're doing. This is not hard to figure out. If you keep doing what you've been doing, you're gonna keep getting what you've been getting. You do reap what you sow. You live in a cause and effect world, baby. There's no way around this. So your goal, when I went broke, I realized my goal is to be weird. My goal is to be different. And personal finance is 80% behavior. It's only 20% head knowledge. So this is not some math formula that you've got a problem with. This is a person in your mirror. I figured out if I can make the guy in my mirror behave, he can be skinny and rich. He's got issues. And once we realize that behavior is what causes people to handle their money poorly or handle it well, then what we've got to decide is our behaviors. And if you have the same behaviors as broke people have when it comes to money, you're gonna have the same results broke people have. You're just gonna be another broke person.

The mortgage about 210. So you have six hundred thousand dollars in what? 335 is about in student loans. We both have advanced degrees and then a lot the rest is really credit cards and personal loans. So you have three hundred thousand dollars of credit cards and personal loans? We have about three hundred thirty-five thousand student loans and about a hundred thirty-six thousand in credit cards, forty-four thousand personal loans, and thirty-five thousand car loans. Okay how old are you? I'm 29. Okay so what in the world? So yeah. Are you both on this or is this just one of you that's completely lost your mind? Well I have the majority of the student loans and he has the majority of the credit cards. My credit card debt is about, it's not great. So why does he at 29 years old run up a hundred grand in credit card debt? Well he's 32 but I think it's one of those things where just making really poor financial decisions thinking be able to pay it down as you go and it doesn't it doesn't happen. Okay so you both have advanced degrees. What are your degrees in? We do. So I have a degree in both of our advanced degrees. No he has an MBA and I have an advanced degree in policy. I work in the government and we actually both do now at this point. Okay so your household income is what? Our household income is about $230. Okay. Is there recognition on both of your parts how absurd this situation is? Yes. Okay. Yes there is. So I think we're both a bit scared and want to do anything we can to avoid. Okay great. Then I'm on your team. I can skip that step. Okay good. Okay well you're you're scared and you should be. You're disgusted and you should be. We are. You're early in the early stages of being sick and tired and being sick and tired and you should be. So here's the thing. You guys have been living at across the board from your education choices to your car purchases to your whatever. You've been living at about 10x where you're going to get to live for the next three years. Okay yep that's true. So I'm getting ready to destroy your life as you know it because your life your lifestyle is considerably above your extremely good income and has been for a period of time and so you've gotten used to spending like you're in Congress. Right. This is going to be very emotional for y'all and you're going to have to look at it through that lens and through a spiritual lens or you're not going to make it. You're going to have to not care what anyone thinks including each other because you're not going to spend any money on anything ever for the next three years.

You attack the little one with a vengeance scorched earth lifestyle. Sell so much stuff the kids think they're next. Take 16 extra jobs. We're getting out of debt. And you pay everything. You stop all investing temporarily and completely focus all your emotional, spiritual, financial, relational energy on that smallest debt. Everything goes on that one. When that one's gone, you take the payment that used to be there and any other money we can squeeze out of our budget and we throw it at number two. And when that one's gone, we take the payments from one and two. The snowball rolls over again. It picks up more snow and you attack number three. The average person for the past 25 years that has done that with great focused intensity, gone crazy to the point their broke friends and relatives thought they needed counseling. They shaved their head. They drank the Kool-Aid. They get out of debt in about 18 to 24 months. Everything but their house.

Created on 2023-02-23 18:11:43+00:00) If you are behind on your payments, how do you do a budget? You have to prioritize your dollars. And that means we're going to take care of what we used to learn, and they no longer teach it in the 8th grade, called civics. The difference in necessities and luxuries, food. There's one. No, eating out is not a necessity. Some of you people, all you know how to make is reservations. And you gotta work on that, okay? So food at home, cheap, that you bought at the grocery store, with a coupon. Food is a necessity. Utilities, lights and water, so you have heat. Once you've gotten food and utilities, we're bellies full and we're warm, number three is shelter. So you take care of your place to live, so you're not homeless, you pay your rent. Now almost everyone can scratch around and make enough money to buy their food, keep their electricity current, if they're first, second and third, and keep your rent paid. And if you'll just get real calm, cool and collected and go, we're going to eat before we do anything, not eat out. We're going to pay the utilities, not cable, before we do anything. We're going to pay rent. And when you do those three things, you got a lot of money, most of you, left over after those three things. The next one's transportation. And until you clear food, utilities, housing and transportation and get them all current, you don't spend anything else on anything. Food, shelter, transportation and utilities, get current on them before you worry about anything else. Everyone else can jump in the creek until that's done.

The crypto market is absolutely tanking due to the tariff news, and people who are using leverage are getting absolutely wrecked. The single biggest lost was a trader who was trying to long ETH, and now has lost $25 million. President Trump is enacting tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China, and those three countries are also planning on retaliatory tariffs against the US. Be prepared to see a lot of red in the stock market tomorrow.

Created on 2025-01-28 06:23:41+00:00) NVIDIA lost over $500 billion in market cap today, the single biggest drop in US history. To put that in perspective, NVIDIA's decline is more than double the market cap of Coca-Cola and exceeds the market cap of both Netflix and Oracle. And all this was due to a Chinese research lab called DeepSeek. Last week, they released a model that they claimed only took $5 million to train in less than two months. Now, why is this such a huge deal? Well, that model, R1, is on par or better than the Western models OpenAI and Anthropic made. And it is significantly cheaper. Not only that, the model is open source, meaning that literally anyone, including you and me, can download it and use it today. That is a gigantic blow to OpenAI and Anthropic because their models are closed. They don't let anyone know what's really behind their technology. Because the US has limited NVIDIA GPU exports to China, the Chinese research lab was also forced to use subpar, lower-grade hardware. And thus, the stock market is now freaking out because everyone's thinking, well, maybe we overinvested in NVIDIA. Maybe we don't need hundreds of billions of dollars of investment if we can get the same results for much, much cheaper. The most hilarious part of all of this is that DeepSeek doesn't even focus on making AI models as their main thing. The founder claimed it was just a side project, and the main way they actually make money is through trading. One question about why make it open source, why reveal all the secrets? He responded that the secret sauce wasn't in the models, but it was actually in the company culture and the people. Is this the beginning of the AI bubble popping? We'll see.

He found the cheapest place he could live in SF, a $400 shoe box that was less than 200 square feet. No bathroom, no kitchen, nothing. And he just dollar cost averaged into Bitcoin for his entire career. That guy retired a very long time ago. The first time Bitcoin hit 20K, he already had over $10 million in assets. The simplest strategy for most people who want crypto exposure is just to invest in Bitcoin and ETH, or better yet, invest in the top 10 or 20 coins, but weighted by their market cap. So basically because Bitcoin is the biggest, he would put the most in there.

And that's especially true on social media. The only people who have an inkling of what's going on have some sort of insider information, and they're sure as hell not gonna share it with you, a random stranger on the internet. Crypto and meme coins have been exploding lately, but this is more akin to gambling than outright investing. Sure, you might get lucky and 1,000 extra returns, but more often than not, you're going to lose most of that money. And if you do happen to know an insider, just be careful not to get caught for insider trading. Good luck.

It was a website that let you trade bitcoin for illicit goods and services and one that Ross personally tried to use to hire some assassins. Now, lucky for Ross, those assassins turned out to be scammers, so they didn't actually carry out his requests. However, law enforcement did find out who he was and he was sentenced to life in prison, but he just got pardoned by Trump. The Silk Road had all of its assets seized by the government, but Ross had a couple wallets lying around that were untouched. And now, after 10 years behind bars, a dormant wallet holding over 6,400 bitcoin has now become active. That's worth just under 680 million dollars. Ross was one of the first major pioneers of the crypto industry, and now he is free and extremely, extremely wealthy.

Created on 2025-01-20 22:27:29+00:00) If you're not rich right now, you better hope to get rich over the next four years. The Trump administration is going to absolutely gut regulations, and so companies and rich people are going to get a lot richer. The wealth gap is absolutely comical at this point, and things are only going to get worse from here. But look on the bright side of things. In the next couple of years, you'll probably have an Android in your home running on AI.

Created on 2025-01-20 22:16:51+00:00) insider who bought 1 million dollars worth of Trump coin less than a minute after it launched has now completely cashed out. That person has now made 300 million dollars in profit. They sold their entire stake in Trump coin right when it hit Robinhood. Even Coinbase is planning to list the Trump coin. So this is just a reminder that you shouldn't buy all the random coins you see on Robinhood, Coinbase, or any other exchange. And that's because their main goal is to make money off of you through trading fees. They don't actually care about the coins that they list.

Created on 2025-01-20 22:12:52+00:00) Now that the President of the United States has launched not one, but two meme coins, this is going to open the floodgates for every single influencer you know to launch their own coin. Prior to this, people were still kind of afraid that they would get in trouble, but this has basically given people the green light to go and do whatever they want. It is ridiculously easy to launch these coins. A 13-year-old could and has done it before. But before you throw your life savings into the next Logan Paul or KSI coin, just be very, very careful because most of these coins, 99% of them, will hit a zero in the long term. It's basically a game of hot potato and you don't want to be stuck holding the bag.

Created on 2025-01-19 17:39:31+00:00) It's only been one day since TikTok went dark in the U.S. and we might already see them back by tomorrow. Trump posted this on Truth Social Sunday morning, saying how he's gonna have executive order his first day in office on Monday. This will effectively delay the TikTok ban until a deal can be made. And his proposal is that the U.S. owns 50% in a joint venture. I'm not at all surprised this is going to happen because ByteDance slash TikTok have a lot of money and money talks. So this is going to be a battle between Meta and the other social media companies and ByteDance slash TikTok to see who has deeper pockets or basically who's willing to pay more money to have their way.

SkipLagged is one of the most well-known because it got sued by airlines and won, or rather the judge threw out the case. The whole idea behind SkipLagged is that you don't go on a connecting flight and it can be cheaper that way. The caveat here is you can't check a bag because bags usually get checked to your final destination and the airlines might issue a warning for using SkipLagged. The next two websites are a bit more traditional, Skyscanner and Kiwi.com. There tend to be better deals if you live near a big city and you'll typically want to check a couple months in advance for the best deals. Good luck!

Created on 2025-01-19 03:12:20+00:00) I started making videos a couple years ago because I am an extremely sore loser and I could not handle losing to my wife. I've made over 3,000 videos since then, published a book, and according to a lot of you, single-handedly crashed the CS market. Now if you could only take away one piece of advice, it would be this. Prioritize the long term over the short term. What does that look like in practice? It means investing money consistently into the S&P 500 and just letting it sit and compound. It means investing in your education, gaining skills so that your future earnings potential is higher. I have complete faith that each and every one of you has the potential to become massively wealthy and successful. Good luck.

Created on 2025-01-19 03:00:08+00:00) So most people think that being a millionaire means you have tons of money to spend, but that's usually not the case. When people envision becoming rich, they envision spending a million dollars. Most millionaires are frugal people. I drive an old 2014 Toyota Camry. We keep our expenses pretty low. The biggest expense we have is probably groceries. At a certain point, you don't really have to look at what the grocery price or restaurant menu prices are, which is pretty nice. We're able to take family vacations, but nothing super extravagant. There's several levels to retiring, and we're probably just in like the lower middle level. We're definitely comfortable, but I wouldn't consider us like obscenely rich. When I was a lot younger, I thought I could retire off of just $1 million, but once you actually hit that number, you'll quickly realize that you need a lot more.

Created on 2025-01-19 02:49:22+00:00) Back when I graduated in 2013, someone asked me what's one stock I would invest in if I couldn't invest in the S&P 500, and I told them Facebook. When you're betting on companies, you're effectively just betting on the people, and more specifically, the founder slash CEO of the company. Zuckerberg is arguably the greatest millennial entrepreneur ever. He's made so many moves that at the time seemed really dumb, but in hindsight, it made perfect sense. With his only misstep recently being the whole metaverse thing, but that got sorted out pretty quick. Not to mention the engineering culture there is still quite strong. It's not a retirement home like Google is. My advice to you is still the same, though. Picking individual stocks is a losing man's game. You're not going to out-compete the hundreds of thousands of people who do this professionally. You have no edge against them, and the best strategy for the long-term is still the S&P 500. Pick the fund with the lowest fees, which will most likely be Vanguard or VOO, and P.S., don't listen to any investment advice on TikTok.

Created on 2025-01-19 02:39:53+00:00) If you're poor and you're going to stay poor, go to a country that's as socialist as possible, probably somewhere in Europe. The floor is a lot higher but the ceiling is a lot lower, meaning it's going to be hard to make a lot of money. If you're poor but you want to be rich, go to the US. The US is still the best place in the entire world to make money. If you are already rich and you just want to chill, enjoy life, go to Canada. Amazing weather, low crime, proximity to the US. And if you're rich and you want to become poor, also go to Europe. They're going to tax the hell out of you and it's going to be very hard to make that money back.

Created on 2025-01-19 02:35:31+00:00) I'm honestly surprised that it's actually happening. I still don't quite expect it to be banned. There's just too much money to be made. Not to mention the US is effectively for sale. So right now, Meta slash Zuckerberg are paying a ton of money to try and get TikTok banned. But you think that China slash ByteDance TikTok don't have the money to reverse that decision? At this point, everyone pretty much knows that the government doesn't care about your best interests, they care about money. If the Chinese government wanted your data, they could definitely get it through other avenues. To me, this basically signals how Western corporations are starting to fear Chinese companies enough to influence legislation to ban them rather than compete. Same thing happened to Huawei, same thing happened to BYD, which by the way, their electric cars are amazing and they are incredibly cheap. And now TikTok is just the latest victim. In the future, we're probably gonna see more and more bans, at least until the Western companies catch up. But in my personal opinion, I'd be surprised if that ban actually sticks. I expect to see all of you very soon.

Created on 2025-01-19 02:31:59+00:00) Duolingo is complete trash. You're not going to learn Chinese by going to Duolingo. I don't know a single person who's used Duolingo, even if they've been on there for years and years with a huge streak, who've actually learned anything to a proficient level. And you're sure as hell not going to learn Chinese, one of the hardest languages to learn ever from an app like Duolingo. If you are actually interested in learning another language, you have to immerse yourself in it. This means traveling somewhere where it's majority Chinese speakers. That doesn't necessarily mean you have to go to China. You could just go to an area that has a bunch of Chinese speaking people, like a Chinatown. Obviously, get a personal tutor. Tutoring is one of the most effective ways to learn. And watch a copious, copious amount of Chinese media. No, that doesn't mean state propaganda. You could watch cartoons or something even. But yeah, don't waste your time or money with Duolingo. If you want to actually learn Chinese, you're going to have to find a teacher and you're going to have to surround yourself with Chinese speakers. Good luck.

Created on 2025-01-19 02:25:24+00:00) Trump is about to pull off the biggest crypto scam in American history. Last night, Donald launched the Trump coin on Truth Social and Twitter. At first, everyone thought that his accounts might have been hacked, but slowly came to realize that no, he was actually doing this. Literally minutes after the coin launched, an insider bought $1 million worth of the coin, which is now worth over $100 million. The founding team controls 80% of the supply and it's not locked, which means they can sell at any point. And they're already making millions upon millions in fees. So my prediction for the most likely scenario on what ends up happening for this coin is that the day that Trump becomes president, he's going to rug pull everyone. And with the entire reasoning being he had to eliminate any conflict of interest, liquidate all his assets before becoming president. So for anyone who's still trying to get in, know that you are going to get rugged. You're going to lose all your money. It's not a question of if, but when. Stay safe out there.

Created on 2025-01-19 02:19:46+00:00) I was in China for the past month, and here are all the pros and cons versus living in the West. The most obvious pro, everything is much, much cheaper. You can eat out every single meal for a family of four and pay less than 30 bucks for an entire day. Take a half hour cab ride in the city, it's less than 10 bucks. Because it's the manufacturing center of the world, you can pretty much order anything you want online and at close to cost. The public infrastructure is simply better. It's cheaper, faster, newer. There's high speed rail going to all the major cities and it's quite comfortable. There's very, very few homeless people. Like I didn't see a single homeless person the entire time and I went to several major cities. Now that all sounds pretty good, but there are some pretty major cons and why I would never personally consider living there. Number one is pollution. There is a crazy amount of smog. The air quality in general is just quite poor. Number two, smoking is still incredibly popular in China. And number three, the pressure that young kids these days face is absolutely insane. I have some younger nieces and nephews and they go to school more than a full-time job. Imagine having two separate jobs and just spending all of your time on studying or school-related activities. And you have to do this or you're gonna fall behind everyone else who is doing the exact same thing. To sum it all up, things are extremely convenient in China, extremely cheap, but based on the pollution alone, I would never want my kids to grow up there.

You can check out the price history for Amazon products via Camel Camel Camel to ensure that you actually are getting a deal rather than just an advertised one. Use FakeSpot to find out if the reviews are actually legitimate, because there's so many fake online reviews these days. Keepa is another Amazon price tracker, but they have an extension that allows you to view the price history right on the Amazon page. And for all the gamers, GG.Deals tells you the price history for all Steam games. For all the gamers, GG.Deals tells you the price history for all Steam games.

It also allows you to view other countries' Netflix catalogs, which is pretty cool. But yeah, it's right up there with using an ad blocker. If you don't use an ad blocker yet, use uBlock Origin.

There's eight billion people in the world. You think you're special enough to be that one person whose entire world revolves around? Which also brings the interesting question, who is the main character of Earth? Like if Earth was a sitcom, who's the protagonist?

You're more likely to pass away in a car crash, be struck by lightning twice, get eaten by a shark, and a myriad of other unlikely events than you are to win the lottery. Also, don't you think it's strange how only the government is allowed to run it? Makes you think that it might be stacked in their favor or something.

They're by far my absolute favorites and they are the Amex Business Platinum and the Chase Sapphire Preferred. Amex has absolutely amazing customer service. It blows Chase away, but not everywhere accepts them. The Chase customer service is mediocre at best, but pretty much everywhere accepts Chase. If you don't do a lot of traveling and can't take advantage of the perks, I don't actually recommend getting either of those cards because they do have an annual fee. You'll probably be a lot better off with the Chase Freedom Unlimited if you don't want that annual fee.

There's a lot of problems with America, but one thing it does right is making a lot of money. It contains many of the world's top companies in basically every single field. If you want to further diversify without spending too much effort, you can also buy a total bond market index and an international stock market index.

The price alone doesn't tell you much, but investors can use something called the PE ratio. That stands for price to earnings, and it's one of the stats you can use to value a company across similar companies. Let me explain. For 10, we have a burger shop called Al's Burgers. They trade for $20 per share on the stock market, and their earnings per share is $2. So therefore, investors are currently paying $10 for every $1 of earnings they generate, meaning that's a PE ratio of 10. Now, Bob's Burgers enters the chat, and their share price is also $20. They're actually much more profitable though, and their earnings per share is $4. That means people are currently paying $5 for every $1 of earnings, or a PE ratio of five. So Al's has a much higher stock price relative to how much they actually earn, so that could mean they're overvalued relative to Bob's Burgers. So Bob's is comparably the better deal. PE ratios vary across all types of industries and companies, so you always need to compare within the same industry. In the case of Apple versus Google, Google trades at a 24 PE compared to Apple's 36.98, so there may be an argument that Google is undervalued relatively to Apple. However, there's much more to investing than just one stat, and I'm gonna make more videos on it, so make sure to follow me for more.

For stocks, the S&P 500 has averaged 10% per year since 1925 or the past 100 years or so. Real estate, however, has returned about 4.2% since 1928, according to the latest data from NYU Stern. With real estate, it's more common to use leverage to multiply returns, as well as there are depreciation strategies to increase your overall return as well. Lastly, crypto. Oh boy, Bitcoin has exploded 100,000% since 2010, but of course it comes with a ton of extreme volatility. It experienced a minus 84% drop from December 2017 to December 2018, which wiped out a lot of crypto investors. There are pros and cons to each of these, but which one are you choosing? Let me know in the comments.

It comes down to the idea that demand for gas is what's called inelastic. Gas is an item people buy that just doesn't have many substitutes. When prices of goods go up, the demand for it should decrease. But with inelastic demand, when the price of gas, say, goes up, the quantity demanded just decreases by a smaller percentage. Demand is relatively unresponsive to price changes in the case of gas because people need this item to drive, even if prices go up. Other goods that are like this could include eggs and milk. But what about goods that are elastic? In other words, they act the opposite. These are much more common and refer to anything that you buy much less of just because the price went up. So if price goes up, demand goes down a lot. Examples include luxury cars, designer clothing, airline tickets, or even concerts. Pricing is super fascinating when it comes to business and economics because if you price something incorrectly, your business could fail. But if the price is right, you could thrive.

But a common mistake people make is that they believe that their entire income is now taxed at 22%, leaving them to make less money, which is just not true. Here's how it actually works. In the first tax bracket, any amount of money you make up to $11,925 per year is taxed at 10%. Then the amount of money you make from 11,926 to 48,745 is taxed at 12%. You see, only dollars that you make in that corresponding bracket are taxed at that rate. In the case of the raise, you'll only pay 22% in taxes on any dollars above 48,476. So for a $50,000 salary, that means only 1524 of it is taxed at 22%. The rest of your salary is taxed at those lower rates, giving you an effective total rate of 12.1%. So making more money is always better. If you enjoy videos about finance and investing, follow me for more.

Number one is that investment income is taxed wildly differently than at your job. So if you make $100,000 in investment income, you'll get taxed at long-term capital gains rates or 15%, $15,000. That same $100,000 in a salary job, you're paying 22.4% in total tax. So what does that tell you? You should probably invest. Number two, any Roth retirement accounts. So these are accounts where all your profits that you make are tax-free and they're so overpowered that the government only lets you put in $7,000 per year if you're under the age of 50 or 8K per year over the age of 50. And number three, QBI deductions. America always encourages small businesses and small business owners and certain freelancers can get up to a 20% deduction on business profits. For example, if you make $190,000 in business income through an LLC, sole proprietorship, S Corp, or any entity with a pass-through income, your total tax owed is $29,522. If you made that at a job, you would owe $36,888 on federal income tax alone. So if you're able to understand how the system is set up and how it incentivizes different people to make money, you're going to be much better off. Follow me if you want a part two of this.

And this is typically the largest holding of any portfolio that I start and it's up 80% in the past five years. Next, I would add $200 of QQQ. That's the ETF giving you exposure to tech and software companies. It's done really well in the past five years, plus 128%. Then I would put $300 into individual stocks. So I would choose three stocks and put $100 into each of them. You want companies that will be around in 40 years. So think of your Apples, your Googles, or your JP Morgans of the world. It's important to not buy any penny stocks. My last $100 is staying in a high yield savings account in cash, waiting for opportunities. And I think this split provides a lot of diversification to stocks via ETFs, as well as you get some concentration into stable long-term companies.

Jetsuite X is the airline that lets you fly semi-privately and for this comparison I flew between LA and San Francisco and I started my timer when the airline announced boarding. For my United flight it took 54 minutes after they announced boarding for us to take off and after a 52 minute flight time I finally got out. All right just got out of the plane two hours and five minutes and about four seconds. Before I reveal how much time JSX saves let's look at the fare difference. For United I paid $135 for my flight to LA and Jetsuite X was $299 for one way. So is the time savings worth the cost? We're gonna break that down but first here's how long it took me. It took one hour and 37 minutes on Jetsuite X for the same segment thereby saving me about 28 minutes. Since the fare difference was $163 to save about a half hour if you value your time and around $330 per hour JSX becomes worth it on just the boarding 2D planning process. I'd also estimate you save about an hour each way because you have light security, you can arrive 20 minutes before your flight, and you don't have to navigate any terminals. Of course this is dependent on how early you get to the airport etc but I'm gonna leave up a breakdown of my times in particular and if you like this video make sure to follow me for more.

First, you wanna pick a brokerage you're comfortable with like Fidelity, Schwab, or M1 Finance and click open an account. Click on retirement and IRAs and then right here, you'll wanna choose open a Roth IRA. Then you need to fill out this. It's some basic information like your name, address, et cetera In your IRA dashboard, make sure to click contribute now. Once you connect your bank account, you can contribute to the Roth IRA. Now the contribution limit, I don't know if you can see this is $7,000 per year or $8,000 per year if you're over the age of 50. Personally, I would just automate it with a monthly recurring transaction of around 300 to $500 per month. Once you have some money in your Roth IRA, you wanna buy some index funds that will grow over time. So the S&P 500 has been growing 8% to 10% annually since it was started. Ticker symbols for that include VOO, SPY, FX, AIX, as well as VFIX. If you get average returns in the market for 40 years, your future balance is going to be $2.365 million. And the crazy part is is that you only contributed about $280,000, the rest is your return. Make sure to follow me for more finance videos like these on your page.

Created on 2025-02-04 17:45:24+00:00) This is how much I made in interest in my high yield savings account for the last three months. Now this includes my emergency fund as well as my savings for a down payment on a future house. So I personally keep about six months of expenses in an emergency fund. And for me, that looks like about $30,000 which I know sounds like a little bit on the high end but I like that peace of mind and it's about 5K a month. Then I have about 132K that I've been accumulating over the years as extra money for a down payment or investment property. I don't wanna invest these funds since I actually might need them soon. So therefore it just stays in my high yield account. In February, I made about $577. Now in January, I made $633.05. And in December, I made $630.15. The reason for the decrease recently is that the Federal Reserve lowered their interest rates a couple months ago. So my January interest was a tad lower. Still though, I get about a 4.5% return on my high yield savings through Wealthfront. And I love the fact that I got paid around $1,840 extra these past three months for literally doing nothing, just existing.

Created on 2025-02-03 15:37:35+00:00) President Trump officially imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, as well as 10% on Chinese goods over the weekend. The market today is reacting awfully because of it. As you can see, everything's in the red. Economists have predicted that tariffs will cause inflation and lower GDP growth, but why do tariffs cause inflation and should we be worried? If a toy costs $10 and Walmart imports it from say Canada, Walmart will now have to pay an extra $2.50 to US customs, thus probably passing on that cost likely to customers. A tariff then would incentivize the US based supplier like Walmart to seek out American made toys instead of Canadian ones. This will also hurt Canada and Mexico's economy way more than it hurts the United States, because currently nearly 80% of both Canada and Mexico's exports go to United States. On the US side, about 16% of US exports go to Canada and Mexico respectively. I think this is just a negotiation tactic by Trump because Canada and Mexico won't be able to sustain this for a long period of time. Both of their economies are more reliant on the US than the US is reliant on them. Now, will the real impact of these tariffs last? Well, I definitely could see GDP being affected as well as inflation. However, I do think that Trump knew all of these things going into it. If you're investing for the long term, such as your retirement, I don't think you need to do anything. Don't abandon your investing plans. However, if you are invested for the short term, such as the next few months, I don't think these tariff issues will be solved until at least the end of Q1. What do you think? Let me know in the comments.

Created on 2025-02-02 19:04:09+00:00) If you make $10,000 in profit on Apple stock, do you know how much tax you would have to pay? It depends entirely on how long you hold the stock as well as if you actually sold the stock. You'll owe taxes when you realize the profit, so that's when you actually sell the stock for a gain. So let's say you sell Apple stock and you realize a $10,000 gain in profit. If you held it for less than one year, you will owe short-term capital gains taxes, and that is taxed at your federal marginal tax rate. So if you make $120,000 per year, that puts you in the 24% marginal tax bracket, that means you will owe $2,400 in taxes on the gain of 10,000. If you're able to hold it for more than a year, your long-term capital gains rate then becomes 0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on your income. In this case, you would owe $1,500 in taxes if you sold it after owning it for more than one year. Now, keep in mind, if you just buy and hold and you don't sell at all, then you don't owe any taxes yet. It's only when you sell the stock.

Well, new, it's going to cost you $45,950, but you should never buy it new because after one year, the resale value is 21% less or $36,000. Cars are depreciating assets, which means that they lose value over time. If you Google car depreciation curve, you can see that all of them go downwards, but we can actually use this to save money. To get the most value, we wanna buy a car after the fourth year of depreciation. That's a used car sweet spot. In the case of the BMW, if you wait four years, that car's only gonna cost you $27,000 or about 51% less. I like to buy a car that's three to four years used, maybe has 15 to 20,000 miles on it, and is perhaps a lease turn back, and then I'm gonna buy it in cash. Follow me for more.

Number one is to start a budget and track how much you spend. Now, a good rule of thumb is to use the 50-30-20 rule. That's where 50% of your budget goes towards needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings. Second is to write down your net worth every quarter or every year to see if it's trending in the right direction. Personally, I tally all my bank accounts and investment accounts, and then I subtract any liabilities or debt that I have, and I try to track it on a regular basis. This habit increases your net worth because you're now paying attention to it, and I'll have a free net worth tracker for you guys down below. Number three is to invest your money and get it to work for you. I talk a lot about investing on this page, but by doing so, you're ensuring that your money isn't just sitting there losing value to inflation. If you're just getting started, putting money into index funds like the S&P 500 are a great way to start, so ticker symbols VOO or SPY. Let me know down below your net worth if you're comfortable in the comments.

Created on 2025-01-28 21:20:44+00:00) If you're able to make your first 100K, the next 100K is a lot easier. Assuming you save 10K per year at a 7% return, it takes you 7.84 years to hit your first 100K, but the next 100K, since your money is working for you, would take you 5.1 years. Fast forward, and we can see that all subsequent 100K increments, each one is faster than the previous. You have money working for you and it's continuing to compound, and as you invest, it's like rolling a giant snowball down the hill. Look at the time between the 400K and 500K mark. You can see it's 2.5 years, and comparing that to the first 100K, it's a lot faster, but don't worry, it gets crazier still. By the time you're approaching the $1 million mark from the $900,000 mark, it's only going to take you 1.35 years for that same 100K. The first 100K takes you 25.5% of the total time it takes to get to a million dollars. The remaining 900K only takes 74.5% of the time, so that's pretty funny. It's like when you hit 100K, you're basically a quarter of the way to a million dollars. I know that sounds weird, but in terms of time, it's true.

It's the number one app in the top free apps. They released an AI model last week that basically rivals LLMs like ChadGBT, and it was created for a fraction of the cost. They claim around $6 million. Investors are worried because it was created without access to NVIDIA's most powerful chips, and NVIDIA's growth and share price relies on the AI industry actually needing those chips. Basically, current market and price levels are super reliant on future AI profits as well as the industry growing. DeepSeek is a huge threat to all that because if some startup from China can come in and do it for a very limited budget without the need for these chips, then the entire AI industry is now called into question. I do feel like the stock price of NVIDIA today seems like an overreaction, but valuations were high already, as you can see, and the S&P 500 is still overvalued compared to what it typically is. And some people on the internet don't believe that it only costs $6 million. Personally, I'm a little skeptical as well, but until we find out more, I'm not entirely sure that this is the end of the AI industry just yet.

Created on 2025-01-26 21:59:25+00:00) If you make the same amount of money as your friend or somebody you know, one of you could be rich versus the other one could end up broke. But why is that? There are three big reasons why that could happen. Now, the first is lifestyle inflation. So in this book, The Millionaire Next Door, the author found that people who often look well off are usually deeply in debt. Physicians and lawyers, for example, usually earn above average incomes, but they also tend to drive luxury cars and live in larger homes because they want to live in the same neighborhoods that their colleagues do. Common mistake number two is being burdened by too much debt. So if your friend has $5,000 in credit card debt for just one year, that's $5,000 they aren't investing. In that single year alone, that $5,000 could grow to over $50,000 in 30 years. Third, there's a lack of tracking or budgeting the money itself. So it's really easy to spend frivolously without knowing the full repercussions of how much you're spending versus how much you're not. If you track your money, you'll have a clear understanding of where your money is going and you won't be as likely to overspend. Do you know anyone that makes a good income yet they're broke? Let me know down below.

Pretend you get average gains in the market of 8% per year and start with $10,000, it would still take you 30 years to hit $100,000 just investing that sum, and nobody wants to wait that long. Charlie Munger, who was Warren Buffet's right-hand man, said it best, the first $100,000 is a bitch, but you gotta do it, I don't care what you have to do. So your first $100,000 actually comes mostly from saving every dollar and investing on top of that. If you save 12K a year for seven years at a 4.5% return, you will have $100,000, but look, 84% of it came from savings, and only 16% of it came from the interest in gains. A lot of the friction in building wealth is at the beginning of the journey, so every dollar when you're starting out saving matters that much more. I hope this helps.

So you gotta make sure you're protecting your money against inflation, and here are three options. Number one is just investing. The easiest way to beat the inflation rate is to invest in the market. So on average, the stock market returns about eight to 10% per year. And if you invest in index funds, you can buy the entire market just with one purchase. The second are treasury inflation protected securities, also known as TIPS. Now, these are government bonds that adjust their principal value with inflation. These aren't perfect by any means, but currently they provide around a 2.2% return above the inflation rate. Number three, you could consider real estate, which generally appreciates over time. Now, keep in mind that this isn't perfect either, but in general, property values and rental income tend to rise with inflation. As long as your money is working for you somehow, it's better than keeping it in a bank account that yields 0.01%. An easy option anybody can do is a high yield savings account for the time being while they pay about 4% per year.

First option are index funds and ETFs tracking the S&P 500. These are low to medium risk over a long-term time horizon and you'll set it and forget it. And it should on average return about 8 to 10% per year. Second, you could go with a three fund portfolio. That's where you have a US stock market index fund, an international stock market index fund and a bond fund. This is more diversified than the first option. So lower risk in general and is overall a solid choice. Third are individual stocks, especially mega caps. Since the Roth IRA gives you tax-free gains, you wanna take full advantage of that with holdings that have high upside. These are riskier, but having a few positions of companies of the caliber of Apple, Google, or Amazon could be good. $1,000 in Apple stock 20 years ago is worth more than $700,000 today. And if you invested in a Roth IRA, then all of those gains would be tax-free. That's the power of it.

In the 1980s, the DynaTAC was rolled out costing $3,995 and you'd get around 30 minutes of talk time and it's projected that those plans cost a few hundred dollars per month. Now in the 1990s, the Bureau of Labor Statistics cited cell services costing around $50 per month with limited talk time and some data usage. Now in the 2000s, the cost of cell phone services ranged but you could get your phone covered for about $30 per month. As more competitors entered the market, prices went down. However, by the 2010s, the introduction of smartphones and data plans meant that cell phone plans started to cost an average of $113 per month for one line with unlimited data, talk and text. But what if you could pay only $25 per month? Metro offers just that with their BYOD or bring your own phone plan. All you have to do is bring the phone you want to add the service to and pay $25 per month. You get unlimited 5G on one line with no contracts or credit checks.

This is going to be the foundation of your portfolio and it's up 83% in the past five years. Second, I'm adding another $3,000 into QQQ. That's the ETF that gives you exposure to the software and tech companies. And in the past five years, it's up 135%. Third, I'm going to add $2,000 into a high yield savings account. And that way I always have some cash on hand in case there are any opportunities to buy up any dips. Let me know if you have any questions. I'll also have some free downloads in my profile.

Bitcoin is the guy that microdoses LSD for breakfast, he lives in an apartment that looks like this, and one day he's spending 5k at the club, but then the next day he's asking you for money. He talks about changing the system, but he can't even commit to dinner plans. Financial stocks are like artists full of potential, one year they can be flying you around the world because they're mega successful, but then society kind of weighs a little bit heavier on them, they're a little bit sensitive, so when people start to talk bad about them, they go into a dark, deep depression, and their stock price falls because of it too. Gold is the old money guy and talks about legacy, he's reliable in tough times, goes skiing in Aspen, and he's going to be happy when everyone else is miserable. And it's especially true when times are tough in the world.

The crypto market is absolutely tanking due to the tariff news, and people who are using leverage are getting absolutely wrecked. The single biggest lost was a trader who was trying to long ETH, and now has lost $25 million. President Trump is enacting tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China, and those three countries are also planning on retaliatory tariffs against the US. Be prepared to see a lot of red in the stock market tomorrow.

Created on 2025-01-28 06:23:41+00:00) NVIDIA lost over $500 billion in market cap today, the single biggest drop in US history. To put that in perspective, NVIDIA's decline is more than double the market cap of Coca-Cola and exceeds the market cap of both Netflix and Oracle. And all this was due to a Chinese research lab called DeepSeek. Last week, they released a model that they claimed only took $5 million to train in less than two months. Now, why is this such a huge deal? Well, that model, R1, is on par or better than the Western models OpenAI and Anthropic made. And it is significantly cheaper. Not only that, the model is open source, meaning that literally anyone, including you and me, can download it and use it today. That is a gigantic blow to OpenAI and Anthropic because their models are closed. They don't let anyone know what's really behind their technology. Because the US has limited NVIDIA GPU exports to China, the Chinese research lab was also forced to use subpar, lower-grade hardware. And thus, the stock market is now freaking out because everyone's thinking, well, maybe we overinvested in NVIDIA. Maybe we don't need hundreds of billions of dollars of investment if we can get the same results for much, much cheaper. The most hilarious part of all of this is that DeepSeek doesn't even focus on making AI models as their main thing. The founder claimed it was just a side project, and the main way they actually make money is through trading. One question about why make it open source, why reveal all the secrets? He responded that the secret sauce wasn't in the models, but it was actually in the company culture and the people. Is this the beginning of the AI bubble popping? We'll see.

He found the cheapest place he could live in SF, a $400 shoe box that was less than 200 square feet. No bathroom, no kitchen, nothing. And he just dollar cost averaged into Bitcoin for his entire career. That guy retired a very long time ago. The first time Bitcoin hit 20K, he already had over $10 million in assets. The simplest strategy for most people who want crypto exposure is just to invest in Bitcoin and ETH, or better yet, invest in the top 10 or 20 coins, but weighted by their market cap. So basically because Bitcoin is the biggest, he would put the most in there.

And that's especially true on social media. The only people who have an inkling of what's going on have some sort of insider information, and they're sure as hell not gonna share it with you, a random stranger on the internet. Crypto and meme coins have been exploding lately, but this is more akin to gambling than outright investing. Sure, you might get lucky and 1,000 extra returns, but more often than not, you're going to lose most of that money. And if you do happen to know an insider, just be careful not to get caught for insider trading. Good luck.

It was a website that let you trade bitcoin for illicit goods and services and one that Ross personally tried to use to hire some assassins. Now, lucky for Ross, those assassins turned out to be scammers, so they didn't actually carry out his requests. However, law enforcement did find out who he was and he was sentenced to life in prison, but he just got pardoned by Trump. The Silk Road had all of its assets seized by the government, but Ross had a couple wallets lying around that were untouched. And now, after 10 years behind bars, a dormant wallet holding over 6,400 bitcoin has now become active. That's worth just under 680 million dollars. Ross was one of the first major pioneers of the crypto industry, and now he is free and extremely, extremely wealthy.

Created on 2025-01-20 22:27:29+00:00) If you're not rich right now, you better hope to get rich over the next four years. The Trump administration is going to absolutely gut regulations, and so companies and rich people are going to get a lot richer. The wealth gap is absolutely comical at this point, and things are only going to get worse from here. But look on the bright side of things. In the next couple of years, you'll probably have an Android in your home running on AI.

That person has now made 300 million dollars in profit. They sold their entire stake in Trump coin right when it hit Robinhood. Even Coinbase is planning to list the Trump coin. So this is just a reminder that you shouldn't buy all the random coins you see on Robinhood, Coinbase, or any other exchange. And that's because their main goal is to make money off of you through trading fees. They don't actually care about the coins that they list.

Created on 2025-01-20 22:12:52+00:00) Now that the President of the United States has launched not one, but two meme coins, this is going to open the floodgates for every single influencer you know to launch their own coin. Prior to this, people were still kind of afraid that they would get in trouble, but this has basically given people the green light to go and do whatever they want. It is ridiculously easy to launch these coins. A 13-year-old could and has done it before. But before you throw your life savings into the next Logan Paul or KSI coin, just be very, very careful because most of these coins, 99% of them, will hit a zero in the long term. It's basically a game of hot potato and you don't want to be stuck holding the bag.

Created on 2025-01-19 17:39:31+00:00) It's only been one day since TikTok went dark in the U.S. and we might already see them back by tomorrow. Trump posted this on Truth Social Sunday morning, saying how he's gonna have executive order his first day in office on Monday. This will effectively delay the TikTok ban until a deal can be made. And his proposal is that the U.S. owns 50% in a joint venture. I'm not at all surprised this is going to happen because ByteDance slash TikTok have a lot of money and money talks. So this is going to be a battle between Meta and the other social media companies and ByteDance slash TikTok to see who has deeper pockets or basically who's willing to pay more money to have their way.

SkipLagged is one of the most well-known because it got sued by airlines and won, or rather the judge threw out the case. The whole idea behind SkipLagged is that you don't go on a connecting flight and it can be cheaper that way. The caveat here is you can't check a bag because bags usually get checked to your final destination and the airlines might issue a warning for using SkipLagged. The next two websites are a bit more traditional, Skyscanner and Kiwi.com. There tend to be better deals if you live near a big city and you'll typically want to check a couple months in advance for the best deals. Good luck!

Created on 2025-01-19 03:12:20+00:00) I started making videos a couple years ago because I am an extremely sore loser and I could not handle losing to my wife. I've made over 3,000 videos since then, published a book, and according to a lot of you, single-handedly crashed the CS market. Now if you could only take away one piece of advice, it would be this. Prioritize the long term over the short term. What does that look like in practice? It means investing money consistently into the S&P 500 and just letting it sit and compound. It means investing in your education, gaining skills so that your future earnings potential is higher. I have complete faith that each and every one of you has the potential to become massively wealthy and successful. Good luck.

Created on 2025-01-19 03:00:08+00:00) So most people think that being a millionaire means you have tons of money to spend, but that's usually not the case. When people envision becoming rich, they envision spending a million dollars. Most millionaires are frugal people. I drive an old 2014 Toyota Camry. We keep our expenses pretty low. The biggest expense we have is probably groceries. At a certain point, you don't really have to look at what the grocery price or restaurant menu prices are, which is pretty nice. We're able to take family vacations, but nothing super extravagant. There's several levels to retiring, and we're probably just in like the lower middle level. We're definitely comfortable, but I wouldn't consider us like obscenely rich. When I was a lot younger, I thought I could retire off of just $1 million, but once you actually hit that number, you'll quickly realize that you need a lot more.

Created on 2025-01-19 02:49:22+00:00) Back when I graduated in 2013, someone asked me what's one stock I would invest in if I couldn't invest in the S&P 500, and I told them Facebook. When you're betting on companies, you're effectively just betting on the people, and more specifically, the founder slash CEO of the company. Zuckerberg is arguably the greatest millennial entrepreneur ever. He's made so many moves that at the time seemed really dumb, but in hindsight, it made perfect sense. With his only misstep recently being the whole metaverse thing, but that got sorted out pretty quick. Not to mention the engineering culture there is still quite strong. It's not a retirement home like Google is. My advice to you is still the same, though. Picking individual stocks is a losing man's game. You're not going to out-compete the hundreds of thousands of people who do this professionally. You have no edge against them, and the best strategy for the long-term is still the S&P 500. Pick the fund with the lowest fees, which will most likely be Vanguard or VOO, and P.S., don't listen to any investment advice on TikTok.

Created on 2025-01-19 02:39:53+00:00) If you're poor and you're going to stay poor, go to a country that's as socialist as possible, probably somewhere in Europe. The floor is a lot higher but the ceiling is a lot lower, meaning it's going to be hard to make a lot of money. If you're poor but you want to be rich, go to the US. The US is still the best place in the entire world to make money. If you are already rich and you just want to chill, enjoy life, go to Canada. Amazing weather, low crime, proximity to the US. And if you're rich and you want to become poor, also go to Europe. They're going to tax the hell out of you and it's going to be very hard to make that money back.

Created on 2025-01-19 02:35:31+00:00) I'm honestly surprised that it's actually happening. I still don't quite expect it to be banned. There's just too much money to be made. Not to mention the US is effectively for sale. So right now, Meta slash Zuckerberg are paying a ton of money to try and get TikTok banned. But you think that China slash ByteDance TikTok don't have the money to reverse that decision? At this point, everyone pretty much knows that the government doesn't care about your best interests, they care about money. If the Chinese government wanted your data, they could definitely get it through other avenues. To me, this basically signals how Western corporations are starting to fear Chinese companies enough to influence legislation to ban them rather than compete. Same thing happened to Huawei, same thing happened to BYD, which by the way, their electric cars are amazing and they are incredibly cheap. And now TikTok is just the latest victim. In the future, we're probably gonna see more and more bans, at least until the Western companies catch up. But in my personal opinion, I'd be surprised if that ban actually sticks. I expect to see all of you very soon.

Created on 2025-01-19 02:31:59+00:00) Duolingo is complete trash. You're not going to learn Chinese by going to Duolingo. I don't know a single person who's used Duolingo, even if they've been on there for years and years with a huge streak, who've actually learned anything to a proficient level. And you're sure as hell not going to learn Chinese, one of the hardest languages to learn ever from an app like Duolingo. If you are actually interested in learning another language, you have to immerse yourself in it. This means traveling somewhere where it's majority Chinese speakers. That doesn't necessarily mean you have to go to China. You could just go to an area that has a bunch of Chinese speaking people, like a Chinatown. Obviously, get a personal tutor. Tutoring is one of the most effective ways to learn. And watch a copious, copious amount of Chinese media. No, that doesn't mean state propaganda. You could watch cartoons or something even. But yeah, don't waste your time or money with Duolingo. If you want to actually learn Chinese, you're going to have to find a teacher and you're going to have to surround yourself with Chinese speakers. Good luck.

Created on 2025-01-19 02:25:24+00:00) Trump is about to pull off the biggest crypto scam in American history. Last night, Donald launched the Trump coin on Truth Social and Twitter. At first, everyone thought that his accounts might have been hacked, but slowly came to realize that no, he was actually doing this. Literally minutes after the coin launched, an insider bought $1 million worth of the coin, which is now worth over $100 million. The founding team controls 80% of the supply and it's not locked, which means they can sell at any point. And they're already making millions upon millions in fees. So my prediction for the most likely scenario on what ends up happening for this coin is that the day that Trump becomes president, he's going to rug pull everyone. And with the entire reasoning being he had to eliminate any conflict of interest, liquidate all his assets before becoming president. So for anyone who's still trying to get in, know that you are going to get rugged. You're going to lose all your money. It's not a question of if, but when. Stay safe out there.

Created on 2025-01-19 02:19:46+00:00) I was in China for the past month, and here are all the pros and cons versus living in the West. The most obvious pro, everything is much, much cheaper. You can eat out every single meal for a family of four and pay less than 30 bucks for an entire day. Take a half hour cab ride in the city, it's less than 10 bucks. Because it's the manufacturing center of the world, you can pretty much order anything you want online and at close to cost. The public infrastructure is simply better. It's cheaper, faster, newer. There's high speed rail going to all the major cities and it's quite comfortable. There's very, very few homeless people. Like I didn't see a single homeless person the entire time and I went to several major cities. Now that all sounds pretty good, but there are some pretty major cons and why I would never personally consider living there. Number one is pollution. There is a crazy amount of smog. The air quality in general is just quite poor. Number two, smoking is still incredibly popular in China. And number three, the pressure that young kids these days face is absolutely insane. I have some younger nieces and nephews and they go to school more than a full-time job. Imagine having two separate jobs and just spending all of your time on studying or school-related activities. And you have to do this or you're gonna fall behind everyone else who is doing the exact same thing. To sum it all up, things are extremely convenient in China, extremely cheap, but based on the pollution alone, I would never want my kids to grow up there.

You can check out the price history for Amazon products via Camel Camel Camel to ensure that you actually are getting a deal rather than just an advertised one. Use FakeSpot to find out if the reviews are actually legitimate, because there's so many fake online reviews these days. Keepa is another Amazon price tracker, but they have an extension that allows you to view the price history right on the Amazon page.

I think I pay like three bucks a year for mine. And no, I'm not sponsored by anyone, but you can find them pretty easily online. It also allows you to view other countries' Netflix catalogs, which is pretty cool. But yeah, it's right up there with using an ad blocker. If you don't use an ad blocker yet, use uBlock Origin.

There's eight billion people in the world. You think you're special enough to be that one person whose entire world revolves around? Which also brings the interesting question, who is the main character of Earth? Like if Earth was a sitcom, who's the protagonist?

You're more likely to pass away in a car crash, be struck by lightning twice, get eaten by a shark, and a myriad of other unlikely events than you are to win the lottery. Also, don't you think it's strange how only the government is allowed to run it? Makes you think that it might be stacked in their favor or something.

They're by far my absolute favorites and they are the Amex Business Platinum and the Chase Sapphire Preferred. Amex has absolutely amazing customer service. It blows Chase away, but not everywhere accepts them. The Chase customer service is mediocre at best, but pretty much everywhere accepts Chase. If you don't do a lot of traveling and can't take advantage of the perks, I don't actually recommend getting either of those cards because they do have an annual fee. You'll probably be a lot better off with the Chase Freedom Unlimited if you don't want that annual fee.

Created on 2025-02-03 02:42:46+00:00) 700,000 traders lost over $2 billion in the past 24 hours. The crypto market is absolutely tanking due to the tariff news, and people who are using leverage are getting absolutely wrecked. The single biggest lost was a trader who was trying to long ETH, and now has lost $25 million. President Trump is enacting tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China, and those three countries are also planning on retaliatory tariffs against the US. Be prepared to see a lot of red in the stock market tomorrow.

Created on 2025-01-28 06:23:41+00:00) NVIDIA lost over $500 billion in market cap today, the single biggest drop in US history. To put that in perspective, NVIDIA's decline is more than double the market cap of Coca-Cola and exceeds the market cap of both Netflix and Oracle. And all this was due to a Chinese research lab called DeepSeek. Last week, they released a model that they claimed only took $5 million to train in less than two months. Now, why is this such a huge deal? Well, that model, R1, is on par or better than the Western models OpenAI and Anthropic made. And it is significantly cheaper. Not only that, the model is open source, meaning that literally anyone, including you and me, can download it and use it today. That is a gigantic blow to OpenAI and Anthropic because their models are closed. They don't let anyone know what's really behind their technology. Because the US has limited NVIDIA GPU exports to China, the Chinese research lab was also forced to use subpar, lower-grade hardware. And thus, the stock market is now freaking out because everyone's thinking, well, maybe we overinvested in NVIDIA. Maybe we don't need hundreds of billions of dollars of investment if we can get the same results for much, much cheaper. The most hilarious part of all of this is that DeepSeek doesn't even focus on making AI models as their main thing. The founder claimed it was just a side project, and the main way they actually make money is through trading. One question about why make it open source, why reveal all the secrets? He responded that the secret sauce wasn't in the models, but it was actually in the company culture and the people. Is this the beginning of the AI bubble popping? We'll see.

Created on 2025-01-23 05:02:50+00:00) 10 years ago, I had a friend who worked with me at Credit Karma and he put all of his money into crypto. He found the cheapest place he could live in SF, a $400 shoe box that was less than 200 square feet. No bathroom, no kitchen, nothing. And he just dollar cost averaged into Bitcoin for his entire career. That guy retired a very long time ago. The first time Bitcoin hit 20K, he already had over $10 million in assets. The simplest strategy for most people who want crypto exposure is just to invest in Bitcoin and ETH, or better yet, invest in the top 10 or 20 coins, but weighted by their market cap. So basically because Bitcoin is the biggest, he would put the most in there.

Created on 2025-01-23 04:57:24+00:00) The truth is, no one knows what XRP, any other crypto, or any asset class is going at all in the future in any capacity. And that's especially true on social media. The only people who have an inkling of what's going on have some sort of insider information, and they're sure as hell not gonna share it with you, a random stranger on the internet. Crypto and meme coins have been exploding lately, but this is more akin to gambling than outright investing. Sure, you might get lucky and 1,000 extra returns, but more often than not, you're going to lose most of that money. And if you do happen to know an insider, just be careful not to get caught for insider trading. Good luck.

Created on 2025-01-23 04:34:55+00:00) be willing to trade 10 years of your life in prison for 600 million dollars? Meet Ross Ulbricht, founder of the Silk Road. It was a website that let you trade bitcoin for illicit goods and services and one that Ross personally tried to use to hire some assassins. Now, lucky for Ross, those assassins turned out to be scammers, so they didn't actually carry out his requests. However, law enforcement did find out who he was and he was sentenced to life in prison, but he just got pardoned by Trump. The Silk Road had all of its assets seized by the government, but Ross had a couple wallets lying around that were untouched. And now, after 10 years behind bars, a dormant wallet holding over 6,400 bitcoin has now become active. That's worth just under 680 million dollars. Ross was one of the first major pioneers of the crypto industry, and now he is free and extremely, extremely wealthy.

Created on 2025-01-20 22:27:29+00:00) If you're not rich right now, you better hope to get rich over the next four years. The Trump administration is going to absolutely gut regulations, and so companies and rich people are going to get a lot richer. The wealth gap is absolutely comical at this point, and things are only going to get worse from here. But look on the bright side of things. In the next couple of years, you'll probably have an Android in your home running on AI.

Created on 2025-01-20 22:16:51+00:00) insider who bought 1 million dollars worth of Trump coin less than a minute after it launched has now completely cashed out. That person has now made 300 million dollars in profit. They sold their entire stake in Trump coin right when it hit Robinhood. Even Coinbase is planning to list the Trump coin. So this is just a reminder that you shouldn't buy all the random coins you see on Robinhood, Coinbase, or any other exchange. And that's because their main goal is to make money off of you through trading fees. They don't actually care about the coins that they list.

Created on 2025-01-20 22:12:52+00:00) Now that the President of the United States has launched not one, but two meme coins, this is going to open the floodgates for every single influencer you know to launch their own coin. Prior to this, people were still kind of afraid that they would get in trouble, but this has basically given people the green light to go and do whatever they want. It is ridiculously easy to launch these coins. A 13-year-old could and has done it before. But before you throw your life savings into the next Logan Paul or KSI coin, just be very, very careful because most of these coins, 99% of them, will hit a zero in the long term. It's basically a game of hot potato and you don't want to be stuck holding the bag.

Created on 2025-01-19 19:10:07+00:00) Less than 12 hours later and TikTok is already unbanned. Users in the United States are coming back as we speak. I hope everyone enjoyed their short break and now back to getting your dopamine receptors fried.

Created on 2025-01-19 17:39:31+00:00) It's only been one day since TikTok went dark in the U.S. and we might already see them back by tomorrow. Trump posted this on Truth Social Sunday morning, saying how he's gonna have executive order his first day in office on Monday. This will effectively delay the TikTok ban until a deal can be made. And his proposal is that the U.S. owns 50% in a joint venture. I'm not at all surprised this is going to happen because ByteDance slash TikTok have a lot of money and money talks. So this is going to be a battle between Meta and the other social media companies and ByteDance slash TikTok to see who has deeper pockets or basically who's willing to pay more money to have their way.

SkipLagged is one of the most well-known because it got sued by airlines and won, or rather the judge threw out the case. The whole idea behind SkipLagged is that you don't go on a connecting flight and it can be cheaper that way. The caveat here is you can't check a bag because bags usually get checked to your final destination and the airlines might issue a warning for using SkipLagged. The next two websites are a bit more traditional, Skyscanner and Kiwi.com. There tend to be better deals if you live near a big city and you'll typically want to check a couple months in advance for the best deals. Good luck!

Created on 2025-01-19 03:12:20+00:00) I started making videos a couple years ago because I am an extremely sore loser and I could not handle losing to my wife. I've made over 3,000 videos since then, published a book, and according to a lot of you, single-handedly crashed the CS market. Now if you could only take away one piece of advice, it would be this. Prioritize the long term over the short term. What does that look like in practice? It means investing money consistently into the S&P 500 and just letting it sit and compound. It means investing in your education, gaining skills so that your future earnings potential is higher. I have complete faith that each and every one of you has the potential to become massively wealthy and successful. Good luck.

Created on 2025-01-19 03:00:08+00:00) So most people think that being a millionaire means you have tons of money to spend, but that's usually not the case. When people envision becoming rich, they envision spending a million dollars. Most millionaires are frugal people. I drive an old 2014 Toyota Camry. We keep our expenses pretty low. The biggest expense we have is probably groceries. At a certain point, you don't really have to look at what the grocery price or restaurant menu prices are, which is pretty nice. We're able to take family vacations, but nothing super extravagant. There's several levels to retiring, and we're probably just in like the lower middle level. We're definitely comfortable, but I wouldn't consider us like obscenely rich. When I was a lot younger, I thought I could retire off of just $1 million, but once you actually hit that number, you'll quickly realize that you need a lot more.

Created on 2025-01-19 02:49:22+00:00) Back when I graduated in 2013, someone asked me what's one stock I would invest in if I couldn't invest in the S&P 500, and I told them Facebook. When you're betting on companies, you're effectively just betting on the people, and more specifically, the founder slash CEO of the company. Zuckerberg is arguably the greatest millennial entrepreneur ever. He's made so many moves that at the time seemed really dumb, but in hindsight, it made perfect sense. With his only misstep recently being the whole metaverse thing, but that got sorted out pretty quick. Not to mention the engineering culture there is still quite strong. It's not a retirement home like Google is. My advice to you is still the same, though. Picking individual stocks is a losing man's game. You're not going to out-compete the hundreds of thousands of people who do this professionally. You have no edge against them, and the best strategy for the long-term is still the S&P 500. Pick the fund with the lowest fees, which will most likely be Vanguard or VOO, and P.S., don't listen to any investment advice on TikTok.

Created on 2025-01-19 02:39:53+00:00) If you're poor and you're going to stay poor, go to a country that's as socialist as possible, probably somewhere in Europe. The floor is a lot higher but the ceiling is a lot lower, meaning it's going to be hard to make a lot of money. If you're poor but you want to be rich, go to the US. The US is still the best place in the entire world to make money. If you are already rich and you just want to chill, enjoy life, go to Canada. Amazing weather, low crime, proximity to the US. And if you're rich and you want to become poor, also go to Europe. They're going to tax the hell out of you and it's going to be very hard to make that money back.

Created on 2025-01-19 02:35:31+00:00) I'm honestly surprised that it's actually happening. I still don't quite expect it to be banned. There's just too much money to be made. Not to mention the US is effectively for sale. So right now, Meta slash Zuckerberg are paying a ton of money to try and get TikTok banned. But you think that China slash ByteDance TikTok don't have the money to reverse that decision? At this point, everyone pretty much knows that the government doesn't care about your best interests, they care about money. If the Chinese government wanted your data, they could definitely get it through other avenues. To me, this basically signals how Western corporations are starting to fear Chinese companies enough to influence legislation to ban them rather than compete. Same thing happened to Huawei, same thing happened to BYD, which by the way, their electric cars are amazing and they are incredibly cheap. And now TikTok is just the latest victim. In the future, we're probably gonna see more and more bans, at least until the Western companies catch up. But in my personal opinion, I'd be surprised if that ban actually sticks. I expect to see all of you very soon.

Created on 2025-01-19 02:31:59+00:00) Duolingo is complete trash. You're not going to learn Chinese by going to Duolingo. I don't know a single person who's used Duolingo, even if they've been on there for years and years with a huge streak, who've actually learned anything to a proficient level. And you're sure as hell not going to learn Chinese, one of the hardest languages to learn ever from an app like Duolingo. If you are actually interested in learning another language, you have to immerse yourself in it. This means traveling somewhere where it's majority Chinese speakers. That doesn't necessarily mean you have to go to China. You could just go to an area that has a bunch of Chinese speaking people, like a Chinatown. Obviously, get a personal tutor. Tutoring is one of the most effective ways to learn. And watch a copious, copious amount of Chinese media. No, that doesn't mean state propaganda. You could watch cartoons or something even. But yeah, don't waste your time or money with Duolingo. If you want to actually learn Chinese, you're going to have to find a teacher and you're going to have to surround yourself with Chinese speakers. Good luck.

Created on 2025-01-19 02:25:24+00:00) Trump is about to pull off the biggest crypto scam in American history. Last night, Donald launched the Trump coin on Truth Social and Twitter. At first, everyone thought that his accounts might have been hacked, but slowly came to realize that no, he was actually doing this. Literally minutes after the coin launched, an insider bought $1 million worth of the coin, which is now worth over $100 million. The founding team controls 80% of the supply and it's not locked, which means they can sell at any point. And they're already making millions upon millions in fees. So my prediction for the most likely scenario on what ends up happening for this coin is that the day that Trump becomes president, he's going to rug pull everyone. And with the entire reasoning being he had to eliminate any conflict of interest, liquidate all his assets before becoming president. So for anyone who's still trying to get in, know that you are going to get rugged. You're going to lose all your money. It's not a question of if, but when. Stay safe out there.

Created on 2025-01-19 02:19:46+00:00) I was in China for the past month, and here are all the pros and cons versus living in the West. The most obvious pro, everything is much, much cheaper. You can eat out every single meal for a family of four and pay less than 30 bucks for an entire day. Take a half hour cab ride in the city, it's less than 10 bucks. Because it's the manufacturing center of the world, you can pretty much order anything you want online and at close to cost. The public infrastructure is simply better. It's cheaper, faster, newer. There's high speed rail going to all the major cities and it's quite comfortable. There's very, very few homeless people. Like I didn't see a single homeless person the entire time and I went to several major cities. Now that all sounds pretty good, but there are some pretty major cons and why I would never personally consider living there. Number one is pollution. There is a crazy amount of smog. The air quality in general is just quite poor. Number two, smoking is still incredibly popular in China. And number three, the pressure that young kids these days face is absolutely insane. I have some younger nieces and nephews and they go to school more than a full-time job. Imagine having two separate jobs and just spending all of your time on studying or school-related activities. And you have to do this or you're gonna fall behind everyone else who is doing the exact same thing. To sum it all up, things are extremely convenient in China, extremely cheap, but based on the pollution alone, I would never want my kids to grow up there.

You can check out the price history for Amazon products via Camel Camel Camel to ensure that you actually are getting a deal rather than just an advertised one. Use FakeSpot to find out if the reviews are actually legitimate, because there's so many fake online reviews these days. Keepa is another Amazon price tracker, but they have an extension that allows you to view the price history right on the Amazon page. And for all the gamers, GG.Deals tells you the price history for all Steam games. For all the gamers, GG.Deals tells you the price history for all Steam games.

I think I pay like three bucks a year for mine. And no, I'm not sponsored by anyone, but you can find them pretty easily online. It also allows you to view other countries' Netflix catalogs, which is pretty cool. But yeah, it's right up there with using an ad blocker. If you don't use an ad blocker yet, use uBlock Origin.

Created on 2024-11-17 04:24:48+00:00) Realistically, if you think about it, so are you. If the entire world only has one main character, the odds of you being that one person are so incredibly low. There's eight billion people in the world. You think you're special enough to be that one person whose entire world revolves around? Which also brings the interesting question, who is the main character of Earth? Like if Earth was a sitcom, who's the protagonist?

Created on 2024-11-09 02:21:08+00:00) It's effectively a tax on people who don't understand math. You're more likely to pass away in a car crash, be struck by lightning twice, get eaten by a shark, and a myriad of other unlikely events than you are to win the lottery. Also, don't you think it's strange how only the government is allowed to run it? Makes you think that it might be stacked in their favor or something.

Created on 2024-11-07 04:23:00+00:00) I've gotten over 30 different credit cards and I only use two of them right now. They're by far my absolute favorites and they are the Amex Business Platinum and the Chase Sapphire Preferred. Amex has absolutely amazing customer service. It blows Chase away, but not everywhere accepts them. The Chase customer service is mediocre at best, but pretty much everywhere accepts Chase. If you don't do a lot of traveling and can't take advantage of the perks, I don't actually recommend getting either of those cards because they do have an annual fee. You'll probably be a lot better off with the Chase Freedom Unlimited if you don't want that annual fee.

Created on 2024-11-05 21:15:38+00:00) That's because the S&P 500 is already diversified. As the name implies, it is 500 companies. There's a lot of problems with America, but one thing it does right is making a lot of money. It contains many of the world's top companies in basically every single field. If you want to further diversify without spending too much effort, you can also buy a total bond market index and an international stock market index.

As someone who struggles to find clothes that fit perfectly, I was so excited to get custom-made pieces in Vietnam. So here's what it's like. First, show them photos of what you want and they'll recreate the style for you. And now for the fun part, you can choose your materials and even the buttons. I went with classic black for a suit and blue silk for a dress. Then onto the measurements. They're quick but thorough. And I couldn't believe it only takes 24 hours to get your clothes made from scratch. So the next day I came back for my fitting. They leave a little room for adjustment so you can tweak anything you like. And that's it. This is the final product. Now you're probably wondering how much it costs. I paid $200 for the suit and $120 for the dress. But could I have gotten it cheaper? Yes, but I love the vibe of this store and I generally think you get what you pay for. Plus back in Australia, a suit like this would easily cost me $350 and it wouldn't fit half as well. So was it worth it? 100% yes for the suit. It fits like a dream. As for the dress, I liked it, but next time I'd probably pass or go to a dress specialist. But I'm curious to hear from you. Do you think it's worth it or not?

Our friends Ravi and Sanjana had the most incredible wedding in Thailand, and honestly, it was the best wedding I've ever been to. We're so grateful we got to celebrate with them. So here's what it cost us to attend. The flights were $450 for all three of us, plus 100,000 Qantas points, which saved us around $1,500. We were asked to buy some traditional outfits. Mine was $138 and Pablo's was $128. We'll wear these outfits to another wedding soon. We spent $570 on accommodation for four nights at the wedding hotel, with breakfast included. Ravi and Sanjana didn't expect any gifts, but we still gave them a cash gift to say thank you. The wedding itself was magical. They had fireworks, incredible food. I'm still thinking about the jalebi and epic dance performances. Ravi and Sanjana obviously slayed, but so did Ravi's mom. She ate and left no crumbs. So in total, we spent $1,286 plus our cash gift. Destination weddings are so fun, but definitely consider the cost before RSVPing. And to budget and track my expenses, I use Billroot. It's super easy to manage your spending, and you can check it out in my bio. And write wedding in the comments if you made it to the end.

First up, let's talk about getting your credit healthy. It's not just about checking your credit score, it's understanding how lenders see you and cleaning up any negative marks on your credit report. A healthy credit report means better options and lower interest rates. Next is the First Home Super Saver Scheme. This allows you to save for your first home in your superannuation, and then withdraw those extra savings when you're ready to buy your first home. You can save on taxes with this scheme, so it's a total win. And finally, we've got the First Home Guarantee. This allows you to buy a home with as little as a 5% deposit without paying for lenders' mortgage insurance, which can help you get your foot on the property ladder much sooner. You can check your credit score for free using Clearscore in my bio, and you'll even get personalised tips to get your home loan ready. And write first home if you made it to the end, you got this.

I have a Tesla Model Y, so I wanted to see how the BYD Seal compared, and it honestly surprised me. Here's what stood out to me. The navigation is a game changer, especially on busy highways. It's got Apple CarPlay, and you can rotate the screen. It's like having a giant iPad in your car. And this one's for the girls. There's even a spot where you can keep your bag, plus there's even a panoramic parking view. The driving experience is really smooth, and I love how you can see the speed that you're driving at really easily. And it's got a 460km range in a single charge, so it's perfect for summer road trips. This car costs from $49,888, but with Origin's EV subscription, you can test the BYD Seal from just $265 per week, without the long-term commitment. Servicing, insurance, and registration is all included in the price, so there are no surprises. And if you'd like to try it, you can check out my bio.

Been investing into myself. I think once you learn more about yourself and the different skills, it opens up all the pathways. So I've been an investor into myself for life. Still Tesla. When we spoke last time, it was a 10X. I think we spoke at the top and then Tesla stock has come down and bounced back up. So it's at about the same level. Oh, that would have to be my apartment. I'm living in it. I have to live it, breathe it, see it every day. I get to touch it. So that would definitely be my best investment. Best investment I've ever made is my own business. In terms of stocks, medical technology company. I just checked just before we started recording. I think I'm up about 3,200% on that one position.

First, I checked my credit score on ClearScore because having a good credit score can help open the door to some of the best travel rewards cards with perks like signup bonuses and VIP benefits. I use ClearScore to monitor my credit health and it even shows me which cards I'm likely to be approved for. The most important part of my strategy is making sure that I am living below my means and paying off my credit card in full every single month. This way, I avoid paying any interest and it keeps my credit score strong, which means I'm more likely to get approved for the best rewards cards in the future. And if you'd like to see where your credit stands, you can check out ClearScore in my bio. Write Burj Khalifa if you're still here.

So let me show you the best parts. First off, the freebies are next level, like free sunscreen, a sample of water drop and Mecca is offering free 50 minute glow ups, make up, skin care, you name it. Pro tip, if you don't want to wait too long, hit up Chemist Warehouse. They're doing free 50 minute services too and they absolutely aced my hair. Did you know you can still watch matches with the grounds pass? My favourite place to watch was John Kane Arena. There are so many seats and if you're staying for the evening games, just grab a wristband from the staff. And if you have a little mini with you like we do, you can also cloak your pram for free. And don't sleep on the practice courts where you can catch all of your favourite players up close. And while you're at it, why not get on top of your finances too? You can check out BillRoo, my budgeting tool, in my bio. And write open if you made it to the end.

But here's the thing, while your credit score is important, it's not the whole picture. When banks and lenders look at your credit, they don't just care about the number. They want to know if you're in a good place financially. Like can you manage debt and do you have enough disposable income to manage your repayments comfortably? And that's why credit health is key. ClearScore is a tool that helps you see how lenders actually see you. It gives you a snapshot into your own financial situation. And understanding these factors can help you improve your overall credit health. And this can help you put your best foot forward when you're applying for things like a mortgage, or getting a credit card with great perks, or even just lowering your interest rate.

So I started investing in crypto back in 2017. I started small just investing $50 here and $100 here and every time I checked my portfolio it kept on growing and it felt like magic. At one point I quadrupled my investment and I seriously thought I was a cryptocurrency genius and at this rate I was going to be a billionaire. But then the market came crashing down, my portfolio lost half of its value and I made a huge mistake which was I panicked and I sold at a loss. It took three years for the market to recover and yes I have been investing in crypto since then and I have been successful and I've made some really good returns but only because I learned these three important lessons. First one is that cryptocurrency is a wild ride so only invest what you're prepared to lose. These days I only invest 5% of my portfolio in crypto. The next lesson is that patience is everything. There are no quick wins and be ready to hold on for years and even then there are still no guarantees. And the final lesson is to stick to the basics. These days I only invest in bitcoin and ethereum because back in 2017 I was investing in all kinds of random coins most of which don't even exist anymore. So if you're thinking about getting into crypto I hope my story saves you some heartache. What's your biggest investing lesson and write Satoshi in the comments if you made it to the end.

Mum loves life's little luxuries while dad prioritised saving and investing. They couldn't find a balance so that's why I became obsessed with finding one. So here's how we do it. We each earn $7,500 monthly and we pay ourselves first so 17% of our pay gets invested. 90% of it is invested in ETFs and the other 10% is invested in crypto and companies we believe in. Last year we didn't travel as much as we normally do and we missed it. So this year we've set aside 16% of our income for travel. It's guilt-free spending because our investments and essentials are covered. To make this work we cut back on clothes and eating out, prioritising travel as our main splurge. It's taken us years of intentional decisions to get here so if you're just starting don't compare your beginning to our middle. And if you want to take control of your finances this year you can check out Billroot our budgeting platform in my bio and write travel if you've made it to the end.

Created on 2025-01-02 06:35:18+00:00) This is how I'd start budgeting if I was a beginner. First pick a budgeting tool, I like using Billo, yes I created it because I needed something simple and effective. But there are heaps of different options out there, each with pros and cons. Then connect your bank account or download your transactions and upload them. And don't worry, our tool only has permission to see your transactions but it can never touch your money. Once the transactions land in your account they'll be auto-categorised, but I also like to double check that they're correct and you can even create your own custom categories. And now for the fun part, seeing where you actually spent your money. It's a bit like being a detective solving the mystery of where your money went. And once you've done that, this is the part where you take control and create a budget. There you have it, you did it! And if you'd like to try Billaroo for yourself you can check out my bio.

Sounds pretty good right? But compared to the $900,000,000 Netflix made from the show, it's a drop in the ocean. For season 2, he reportedly asked for $1,000,000 per episode. But here's where it gets interesting. The show's creator, Hwang Jung Yeok, said he wasn't paid much for season 1 despite its massive success. He even lost 9 teeth from stress while making it. So that's why he's back for more seasons, he's ready to cash in. But here's the thing, unlike Spotify or movie studios, Netflix doesn't share its profits with its creators or cast. They pay up front whether a show flops or goes viral. This works most of the time, but when a series like Squid Game becomes a massive success, do you think that the creators and cast should get a bigger cut? What do you think?

Now what if you started 10 years ago and buckle up because it gets wild. With IVV you'd have $3,600, EGS $2,500 and VAS with over $1,400. And these numbers don't even include the dividends that you would have earned along the way. The moral of the story is that investing is a long-term game. Some years like 2024 might be up and others might be down but staying the course and investing for the long term can make a world of difference.

I'm usually super busy during the week, so on weekends I like to go out and keep organised. If I had unlimited weekend data with Optus prepaid, then I could work on the go, whether that's editing videos from a cafe, planning my week ahead, or like today, reconciling my finances. So let me show you how I made extra money this week. I started by selling some items I don't use anymore, like a baby carrier and a play gym for $40 each. I sold some camera equipment for $250, I made $60 in passive income from my social channels, and I cashed out $100 from cashback apps. So in total, I made an extra $490 this weekend. Unlimited data every weekend with Optus prepaid would be great and really suit me. And the best part is, you can get it on select plans with auto recharge starting from just $35, available to the end of summer. It's perfect for those looking for ways to save extra money. So what would you do with unlimited weekend data? Let me know in the comments.

Nope, Universal said they were paid equally, but it gets even better. Before signing their contracts, Ariana and Cynthia called each other and they compared their contract terms. So they made sure that they both got what they deserved. If one of them needed something, the other backed them up. This is salary transparency at its finest. Whether you're in Hollywood or working a corporate job, talking about pay ensures fairness for everybody. I used to do this with co-workers and even now as a content creator and entrepreneur, I still do this with my friends. But what are your thoughts on pay transparency?

","You are analyzing social media posts to identify individuals who may be finfluencers. A finfluencer is someone who uses their online presence to promote financial products, services, or strategies, often in an engaging and emotionally-driven style. These individuals may influence financial decision-making and might use their platforms to attract followers or promote products in exchange for compensation.

Here are some criteria for identifying the accounts of finfluencers:
· Posts promote specific financial products, services, or platforms (e.g., trading apps, cryptocurrencies, investment courses).
· The tone is promotional or emotionally driven, often including success stories or calls to action (e.g., ""Don't miss out on this opportunity!"").
· Visual elements such as screenshots of profits, bold text, or lifestyle displays implying wealth and success.
· Use of financial buzzwords (e.g., ""passive income,"" ""financial freedom,"" ""crypto gains"").

The price alone doesn't tell you much, but investors can use something called the PE ratio. That stands for price to earnings, and it's one of the stats you can use to value a company across similar companies. Let me explain. For 10, we have a burger shop called Al's Burgers. They trade for $20 per share on the stock market, and their earnings per share is $2. So therefore, investors are currently paying $10 for every $1 of earnings they generate, meaning that's a PE ratio of 10. Now, Bob's Burgers enters the chat, and their share price is also $20. They're actually much more profitable though, and their earnings per share is $4. That means people are currently paying $5 for every $1 of earnings, or a PE ratio of five. So Al's has a much higher stock price relative to how much they actually earn, so that could mean they're overvalued relative to Bob's Burgers. So Bob's is comparably the better deal. PE ratios vary across all types of industries and companies, so you always need to compare within the same industry. In the case of Apple versus Google, Google trades at a 24 PE compared to Apple's 36.98, so there may be an argument that Google is undervalued relatively to Apple. However, there's much more to investing than just one stat, and I'm gonna make more videos on it, so make sure to follow me for more.

For stocks, the S&P 500 has averaged 10% per year since 1925 or the past 100 years or so. Real estate, however, has returned about 4.2% since 1928, according to the latest data from NYU Stern. With real estate, it's more common to use leverage to multiply returns, as well as there are depreciation strategies to increase your overall return as well. Lastly, crypto. Oh boy, Bitcoin has exploded 100,000% since 2010, but of course it comes with a ton of extreme volatility. It experienced a minus 84% drop from December 2017 to December 2018, which wiped out a lot of crypto investors. There are pros and cons to each of these, but which one are you choosing? Let me know in the comments.

It comes down to the idea that demand for gas is what's called inelastic. Gas is an item people buy that just doesn't have many substitutes. When prices of goods go up, the demand for it should decrease. But with inelastic demand, when the price of gas, say, goes up, the quantity demanded just decreases by a smaller percentage. Demand is relatively unresponsive to price changes in the case of gas because people need this item to drive, even if prices go up. Other goods that are like this could include eggs and milk. But what about goods that are elastic? In other words, they act the opposite. These are much more common and refer to anything that you buy much less of just because the price went up. So if price goes up, demand goes down a lot. Examples include luxury cars, designer clothing, airline tickets, or even concerts. Pricing is super fascinating when it comes to business and economics because if you price something incorrectly, your business could fail. But if the price is right, you could thrive.

But a common mistake people make is that they believe that their entire income is now taxed at 22%, leaving them to make less money, which is just not true. Here's how it actually works. In the first tax bracket, any amount of money you make up to $11,925 per year is taxed at 10%. Then the amount of money you make from 11,926 to 48,745 is taxed at 12%. You see, only dollars that you make in that corresponding bracket are taxed at that rate. In the case of the raise, you'll only pay 22% in taxes on any dollars above 48,476. So for a $50,000 salary, that means only 1524 of it is taxed at 22%. The rest of your salary is taxed at those lower rates, giving you an effective total rate of 12.1%. So making more money is always better. If you enjoy videos about finance and investing, follow me for more.

Number one is that investment income is taxed wildly differently than at your job. So if you make $100,000 in investment income, you'll get taxed at long-term capital gains rates or 15%, $15,000. That same $100,000 in a salary job, you're paying 22.4% in total tax. So what does that tell you? You should probably invest. Number two, any Roth retirement accounts. So these are accounts where all your profits that you make are tax-free and they're so overpowered that the government only lets you put in $7,000 per year if you're under the age of 50 or 8K per year over the age of 50. And number three, QBI deductions. America always encourages small businesses and small business owners and certain freelancers can get up to a 20% deduction on business profits. For example, if you make $190,000 in business income through an LLC, sole proprietorship, S Corp, or any entity with a pass-through income, your total tax owed is $29,522. If you made that at a job, you would owe $36,888 on federal income tax alone. So if you're able to understand how the system is set up and how it incentivizes different people to make money, you're going to be much better off. Follow me if you want a part two of this.

And this is typically the largest holding of any portfolio that I start and it's up 80% in the past five years. Next, I would add $200 of QQQ. That's the ETF giving you exposure to tech and software companies. It's done really well in the past five years, plus 128%. Then I would put $300 into individual stocks. So I would choose three stocks and put $100 into each of them. You want companies that will be around in 40 years. So think of your Apples, your Googles, or your JP Morgans of the world. It's important to not buy any penny stocks. My last $100 is staying in a high yield savings account in cash, waiting for opportunities. And I think this split provides a lot of diversification to stocks via ETFs, as well as you get some concentration into stable long-term companies.

Jetsuite X is the airline that lets you fly semi-privately and for this comparison I flew between LA and San Francisco and I started my timer when the airline announced boarding. For my United flight it took 54 minutes after they announced boarding for us to take off and after a 52 minute flight time I finally got out. All right just got out of the plane two hours and five minutes and about four seconds. Before I reveal how much time JSX saves let's look at the fare difference. For United I paid $135 for my flight to LA and Jetsuite X was $299 for one way. So is the time savings worth the cost? We're gonna break that down but first here's how long it took me. It took one hour and 37 minutes on Jetsuite X for the same segment thereby saving me about 28 minutes. Since the fare difference was $163 to save about a half hour if you value your time and around $330 per hour JSX becomes worth it on just the boarding 2D planning process. I'd also estimate you save about an hour each way because you have light security, you can arrive 20 minutes before your flight, and you don't have to navigate any terminals. Of course this is dependent on how early you get to the airport etc but I'm gonna leave up a breakdown of my times in particular and if you like this video make sure to follow me for more.

First, you wanna pick a brokerage you're comfortable with like Fidelity, Schwab, or M1 Finance and click open an account. Click on retirement and IRAs and then right here, you'll wanna choose open a Roth IRA. Then you need to fill out this. It's some basic information like your name, address, et cetera In your IRA dashboard, make sure to click contribute now. Once you connect your bank account, you can contribute to the Roth IRA. Now the contribution limit, I don't know if you can see this is $7,000 per year or $8,000 per year if you're over the age of 50. Personally, I would just automate it with a monthly recurring transaction of around 300 to $500 per month. Once you have some money in your Roth IRA, you wanna buy some index funds that will grow over time. So the S&P 500 has been growing 8% to 10% annually since it was started. Ticker symbols for that include VOO, SPY, FX, AIX, as well as VFIX. If you get average returns in the market for 40 years, your future balance is going to be $2.365 million. And the crazy part is is that you only contributed about $280,000, the rest is your return. Make sure to follow me for more finance videos like these on your page.

Created on 2025-02-04 17:45:24+00:00) This is how much I made in interest in my high yield savings account for the last three months. Now this includes my emergency fund as well as my savings for a down payment on a future house. So I personally keep about six months of expenses in an emergency fund. And for me, that looks like about $30,000 which I know sounds like a little bit on the high end but I like that peace of mind and it's about 5K a month. Then I have about 132K that I've been accumulating over the years as extra money for a down payment or investment property. I don't wanna invest these funds since I actually might need them soon. So therefore it just stays in my high yield account. In February, I made about $577. Now in January, I made $633.05. And in December, I made $630.15. The reason for the decrease recently is that the Federal Reserve lowered their interest rates a couple months ago. So my January interest was a tad lower. Still though, I get about a 4.5% return on my high yield savings through Wealthfront. And I love the fact that I got paid around $1,840 extra these past three months for literally doing nothing, just existing.

Created on 2025-02-03 15:37:35+00:00) President Trump officially imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, as well as 10% on Chinese goods over the weekend. The market today is reacting awfully because of it. As you can see, everything's in the red. Economists have predicted that tariffs will cause inflation and lower GDP growth, but why do tariffs cause inflation and should we be worried? If a toy costs $10 and Walmart imports it from say Canada, Walmart will now have to pay an extra $2.50 to US customs, thus probably passing on that cost likely to customers. A tariff then would incentivize the US based supplier like Walmart to seek out American made toys instead of Canadian ones. This will also hurt Canada and Mexico's economy way more than it hurts the United States, because currently nearly 80% of both Canada and Mexico's exports go to United States. On the US side, about 16% of US exports go to Canada and Mexico respectively. I think this is just a negotiation tactic by Trump because Canada and Mexico won't be able to sustain this for a long period of time. Both of their economies are more reliant on the US than the US is reliant on them. Now, will the real impact of these tariffs last? Well, I definitely could see GDP being affected as well as inflation. However, I do think that Trump knew all of these things going into it. If you're investing for the long term, such as your retirement, I don't think you need to do anything. Don't abandon your investing plans. However, if you are invested for the short term, such as the next few months, I don't think these tariff issues will be solved until at least the end of Q1. What do you think? Let me know in the comments.

Created on 2025-02-02 19:04:09+00:00) If you make $10,000 in profit on Apple stock, do you know how much tax you would have to pay? It depends entirely on how long you hold the stock as well as if you actually sold the stock. You'll owe taxes when you realize the profit, so that's when you actually sell the stock for a gain. So let's say you sell Apple stock and you realize a $10,000 gain in profit. If you held it for less than one year, you will owe short-term capital gains taxes, and that is taxed at your federal marginal tax rate. So if you make $120,000 per year, that puts you in the 24% marginal tax bracket, that means you will owe $2,400 in taxes on the gain of 10,000. If you're able to hold it for more than a year, your long-term capital gains rate then becomes 0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on your income. In this case, you would owe $1,500 in taxes if you sold it after owning it for more than one year. Now, keep in mind, if you just buy and hold and you don't sell at all, then you don't owe any taxes yet. It's only when you sell the stock.

Well, new, it's going to cost you $45,950, but you should never buy it new because after one year, the resale value is 21% less or $36,000. Cars are depreciating assets, which means that they lose value over time. If you Google car depreciation curve, you can see that all of them go downwards, but we can actually use this to save money. To get the most value, we wanna buy a car after the fourth year of depreciation. That's a used car sweet spot. In the case of the BMW, if you wait four years, that car's only gonna cost you $27,000 or about 51% less. I like to buy a car that's three to four years used, maybe has 15 to 20,000 miles on it, and is perhaps a lease turn back, and then I'm gonna buy it in cash. Follow me for more.

Number one is to start a budget and track how much you spend. Now, a good rule of thumb is to use the 50-30-20 rule. That's where 50% of your budget goes towards needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings. Second is to write down your net worth every quarter or every year to see if it's trending in the right direction. Personally, I tally all my bank accounts and investment accounts, and then I subtract any liabilities or debt that I have, and I try to track it on a regular basis. This habit increases your net worth because you're now paying attention to it, and I'll have a free net worth tracker for you guys down below. Number three is to invest your money and get it to work for you. I talk a lot about investing on this page, but by doing so, you're ensuring that your money isn't just sitting there losing value to inflation. If you're just getting started, putting money into index funds like the S&P 500 are a great way to start, so ticker symbols VOO or SPY. Let me know down below your net worth if you're comfortable in the comments.

Created on 2025-01-28 21:20:44+00:00) If you're able to make your first 100K, the next 100K is a lot easier. Assuming you save 10K per year at a 7% return, it takes you 7.84 years to hit your first 100K, but the next 100K, since your money is working for you, would take you 5.1 years. Fast forward, and we can see that all subsequent 100K increments, each one is faster than the previous. You have money working for you and it's continuing to compound, and as you invest, it's like rolling a giant snowball down the hill. Look at the time between the 400K and 500K mark. You can see it's 2.5 years, and comparing that to the first 100K, it's a lot faster, but don't worry, it gets crazier still. By the time you're approaching the $1 million mark from the $900,000 mark, it's only going to take you 1.35 years for that same 100K. The first 100K takes you 25.5% of the total time it takes to get to a million dollars. The remaining 900K only takes 74.5% of the time, so that's pretty funny. It's like when you hit 100K, you're basically a quarter of the way to a million dollars. I know that sounds weird, but in terms of time, it's true.

Created on 2025-01-27 20:04:39+00:00) Tech and AI stocks are tanking hard today with NVIDIA down over 15%. And the reason is because of Chinese startup DeepSeek. It's the number one app in the top free apps. They released an AI model last week that basically rivals LLMs like ChadGBT, and it was created for a fraction of the cost. They claim around $6 million. Investors are worried because it was created without access to NVIDIA's most powerful chips, and NVIDIA's growth and share price relies on the AI industry actually needing those chips. Basically, current market and price levels are super reliant on future AI profits as well as the industry growing. DeepSeek is a huge threat to all that because if some startup from China can come in and do it for a very limited budget without the need for these chips, then the entire AI industry is now called into question. I do feel like the stock price of NVIDIA today seems like an overreaction, but valuations were high already, as you can see, and the S&P 500 is still overvalued compared to what it typically is. And some people on the internet don't believe that it only costs $6 million. Personally, I'm a little skeptical as well, but until we find out more, I'm not entirely sure that this is the end of the AI industry just yet.

Created on 2025-01-26 21:59:25+00:00) If you make the same amount of money as your friend or somebody you know, one of you could be rich versus the other one could end up broke. But why is that? There are three big reasons why that could happen. Now, the first is lifestyle inflation. So in this book, The Millionaire Next Door, the author found that people who often look well off are usually deeply in debt. Physicians and lawyers, for example, usually earn above average incomes, but they also tend to drive luxury cars and live in larger homes because they want to live in the same neighborhoods that their colleagues do. Common mistake number two is being burdened by too much debt. So if your friend has $5,000 in credit card debt for just one year, that's $5,000 they aren't investing. In that single year alone, that $5,000 could grow to over $50,000 in 30 years. Third, there's a lack of tracking or budgeting the money itself. So it's really easy to spend frivolously without knowing the full repercussions of how much you're spending versus how much you're not. If you track your money, you'll have a clear understanding of where your money is going and you won't be as likely to overspend. Do you know anyone that makes a good income yet they're broke? Let me know down below.

Created on 2025-01-26 00:02:09+00:00) You're gonna make your first 100K, it's not gonna come from investing, and that's something that people don't get. Pretend you get average gains in the market of 8% per year and start with $10,000, it would still take you 30 years to hit $100,000 just investing that sum, and nobody wants to wait that long. Charlie Munger, who was Warren Buffet's right-hand man, said it best, the first $100,000 is a bitch, but you gotta do it, I don't care what you have to do. So your first $100,000 actually comes mostly from saving every dollar and investing on top of that. If you save 12K a year for seven years at a 4.5% return, you will have $100,000, but look, 84% of it came from savings, and only 16% of it came from the interest in gains. A lot of the friction in building wealth is at the beginning of the journey, so every dollar when you're starting out saving matters that much more. I hope this helps.

So you gotta make sure you're protecting your money against inflation, and here are three options. Number one is just investing. The easiest way to beat the inflation rate is to invest in the market. So on average, the stock market returns about eight to 10% per year. And if you invest in index funds, you can buy the entire market just with one purchase. The second are treasury inflation protected securities, also known as TIPS. Now, these are government bonds that adjust their principal value with inflation. These aren't perfect by any means, but currently they provide around a 2.2% return above the inflation rate. Number three, you could consider real estate, which generally appreciates over time. Now, keep in mind that this isn't perfect either, but in general, property values and rental income tend to rise with inflation. As long as your money is working for you somehow, it's better than keeping it in a bank account that yields 0.01%. An easy option anybody can do is a high yield savings account for the time being while they pay about 4% per year.

Created on 2025-01-22 22:12:50+00:00) Everyone tells you to get a Roth IRA, but no one tells you what to invest in. Here are three options to invest in with the riskiest one being last. First option are index funds and ETFs tracking the S&P 500. These are low to medium risk over a long-term time horizon and you'll set it and forget it. And it should on average return about 8 to 10% per year. Second, you could go with a three fund portfolio. That's where you have a US stock market index fund, an international stock market index fund and a bond fund. This is more diversified than the first option. So lower risk in general and is overall a solid choice. Third are individual stocks, especially mega caps. Since the Roth IRA gives you tax-free gains, you wanna take full advantage of that with holdings that have high upside. These are riskier, but having a few positions of companies of the caliber of Apple, Google, or Amazon could be good. $1,000 in Apple stock 20 years ago is worth more than $700,000 today. And if you invested in a Roth IRA, then all of those gains would be tax-free. That's the power of it.

Created on 2025-01-22 18:01:24+00:00) Here's what cell phone service bills were in the 1980s to today and how they've changed. In the 1980s, the DynaTAC was rolled out costing $3,995 and you'd get around 30 minutes of talk time and it's projected that those plans cost a few hundred dollars per month. Now in the 1990s, the Bureau of Labor Statistics cited cell services costing around $50 per month with limited talk time and some data usage. Now in the 2000s, the cost of cell phone services ranged but you could get your phone covered for about $30 per month. As more competitors entered the market, prices went down. However, by the 2010s, the introduction of smartphones and data plans meant that cell phone plans started to cost an average of $113 per month for one line with unlimited data, talk and text. But what if you could pay only $25 per month? Metro offers just that with their BYOD or bring your own phone plan. All you have to do is bring the phone you want to add the service to and pay $25 per month. You get unlimited 5G on one line with no contracts or credit checks.

This is going to be the foundation of your portfolio and it's up 83% in the past five years. Second, I'm adding another $3,000 into QQQ. That's the ETF that gives you exposure to the software and tech companies. And in the past five years, it's up 135%. Third, I'm going to add $2,000 into a high yield savings account. And that way I always have some cash on hand in case there are any opportunities to buy up any dips. Let me know if you have any questions. I'll also have some free downloads in my profile.

Bitcoin is the guy that microdoses LSD for breakfast, he lives in an apartment that looks like this, and one day he's spending 5k at the club, but then the next day he's asking you for money. He talks about changing the system, but he can't even commit to dinner plans. Financial stocks are like artists full of potential, one year they can be flying you around the world because they're mega successful, but then society kind of weighs a little bit heavier on them, they're a little bit sensitive, so when people start to talk bad about them, they go into a dark, deep depression, and their stock price falls because of it too. Gold is the old money guy and talks about legacy, he's reliable in tough times, goes skiing in Aspen, and he's going to be happy when everyone else is miserable. And it's especially true when times are tough in the world.

As someone who struggles to find clothes that fit perfectly, I was so excited to get custom-made pieces in Vietnam. So here's what it's like. First, show them photos of what you want and they'll recreate the style for you. And now for the fun part, you can choose your materials and even the buttons. I went with classic black for a suit and blue silk for a dress. Then onto the measurements. They're quick but thorough. And I couldn't believe it only takes 24 hours to get your clothes made from scratch. So the next day I came back for my fitting. They leave a little room for adjustment so you can tweak anything you like. And that's it. This is the final product. Now you're probably wondering how much it costs. I paid $200 for the suit and $120 for the dress. But could I have gotten it cheaper? Yes, but I love the vibe of this store and I generally think you get what you pay for. Plus back in Australia, a suit like this would easily cost me $350 and it wouldn't fit half as well. So was it worth it? 100% yes for the suit. It fits like a dream. As for the dress, I liked it, but next time I'd probably pass or go to a dress specialist. But I'm curious to hear from you. Do you think it's worth it or not? And if you're looking to get on top of your finances and budget for cool experiences like this, you can check out Billrow in my bio.

Our friends Ravi and Sanjana had the most incredible wedding in Thailand, and honestly, it was the best wedding I've ever been to. We're so grateful we got to celebrate with them. So here's what it cost us to attend. The flights were $450 for all three of us, plus 100,000 Qantas points, which saved us around $1,500. We were asked to buy some traditional outfits. Mine was $138 and Pablo's was $128. We'll wear these outfits to another wedding soon. We spent $570 on accommodation for four nights at the wedding hotel, with breakfast included. Ravi and Sanjana didn't expect any gifts, but we still gave them a cash gift to say thank you. The wedding itself was magical. They had fireworks, incredible food. I'm still thinking about the jalebi and epic dance performances. Ravi and Sanjana obviously slayed, but so did Ravi's mom. She ate and left no crumbs. So in total, we spent $1,286 plus our cash gift. Destination weddings are so fun, but definitely consider the cost before RSVPing. And to budget and track my expenses, I use Billroot. It's super easy to manage your spending, and you can check it out in my bio. And write wedding in the comments if you made it to the end.

First up, let's talk about getting your credit healthy. It's not just about checking your credit score, it's understanding how lenders see you and cleaning up any negative marks on your credit report. A healthy credit report means better options and lower interest rates. Next is the First Home Super Saver Scheme. This allows you to save for your first home in your superannuation, and then withdraw those extra savings when you're ready to buy your first home. You can save on taxes with this scheme, so it's a total win. And finally, we've got the First Home Guarantee. This allows you to buy a home with as little as a 5% deposit without paying for lenders' mortgage insurance, which can help you get your foot on the property ladder much sooner. You can check your credit score for free using Clearscore in my bio, and you'll even get personalised tips to get your home loan ready. And write first home if you made it to the end, you got this.

I have a Tesla Model Y, so I wanted to see how the BYD Seal compared, and it honestly surprised me. Here's what stood out to me. The navigation is a game changer, especially on busy highways. It's got Apple CarPlay, and you can rotate the screen. It's like having a giant iPad in your car. And this one's for the girls. There's even a spot where you can keep your bag, plus there's even a panoramic parking view. The driving experience is really smooth, and I love how you can see the speed that you're driving at really easily. And it's got a 460km range in a single charge, so it's perfect for summer road trips. This car costs from $49,888, but with Origin's EV subscription, you can test the BYD Seal from just $265 per week, without the long-term commitment. Servicing, insurance, and registration is all included in the price, so there are no surprises. And if you'd like to try it, you can check out my bio.

Been investing into myself. I think once you learn more about yourself and the different skills, it opens up all the pathways. So I've been an investor into myself for life. Still Tesla. When we spoke last time, it was a 10X. I think we spoke at the top and then Tesla stock has come down and bounced back up. So it's at about the same level. Oh, that would have to be my apartment. I'm living in it. I have to live it, breathe it, see it every day. I get to touch it. So that would definitely be my best investment. Best investment I've ever made is my own business. In terms of stocks, medical technology company. I just checked just before we started recording. I think I'm up about 3,200% on that one position.

First, I checked my credit score on ClearScore because having a good credit score can help open the door to some of the best travel rewards cards with perks like signup bonuses and VIP benefits. I use ClearScore to monitor my credit health and it even shows me which cards I'm likely to be approved for. The most important part of my strategy is making sure that I am living below my means and paying off my credit card in full every single month. This way, I avoid paying any interest and it keeps my credit score strong, which means I'm more likely to get approved for the best rewards cards in the future. And if you'd like to see where your credit stands, you can check out ClearScore in my bio. Write Burj Khalifa if you're still here.

So let me show you the best parts. First off, the freebies are next level, like free sunscreen, a sample of water drop and Mecca is offering free 50 minute glow ups, make up, skin care, you name it. Pro tip, if you don't want to wait too long, hit up Chemist Warehouse. They're doing free 50 minute services too and they absolutely aced my hair. Did you know you can still watch matches with the grounds pass? My favourite place to watch was John Kane Arena. There are so many seats and if you're staying for the evening games, just grab a wristband from the staff. And if you have a little mini with you like we do, you can also cloak your pram for free. And don't sleep on the practice courts where you can catch all of your favourite players up close. And while you're at it, why not get on top of your finances too? You can check out BillRoo, my budgeting tool, in my bio. And write open if you made it to the end.

Created on 2025-01-16 06:34:56+00:00) It's time to check my credit health with ClearScore. Wish me luck! Why am I nervous? So my score is 889, which is above the average of 695. Not bad right? But here's the thing, while your credit score is important, it's not the whole picture. When banks and lenders look at your credit, they don't just care about the number. They want to know if you're in a good place financially. Like can you manage debt and do you have enough disposable income to manage your repayments comfortably? And that's why credit health is key. ClearScore is a tool that helps you see how lenders actually see you. It gives you a snapshot into your own financial situation. And understanding these factors can help you improve your overall credit health. And this can help you put your best foot forward when you're applying for things like a mortgage, or getting a credit card with great perks, or even just lowering your interest rate. And you can check your credit health for free in my bio.

Created on 2025-01-09 22:47:07+00:00) ready with me while I share an embarrassing story about my first time investing in crypto and the things that I've learned along the way so you don't make the same mistakes. So I started investing in crypto back in 2017. I started small just investing $50 here and $100 here and every time I checked my portfolio it kept on growing and it felt like magic. At one point I quadrupled my investment and I seriously thought I was a cryptocurrency genius and at this rate I was going to be a billionaire. But then the market came crashing down, my portfolio lost half of its value and I made a huge mistake which was I panicked and I sold at a loss. It took three years for the market to recover and yes I have been investing in crypto since then and I have been successful and I've made some really good returns but only because I learned these three important lessons. First one is that cryptocurrency is a wild ride so only invest what you're prepared to lose. These days I only invest 5% of my portfolio in crypto. The next lesson is that patience is everything. There are no quick wins and be ready to hold on for years and even then there are still no guarantees. And the final lesson is to stick to the basics. These days I only invest in bitcoin and ethereum because back in 2017 I was investing in all kinds of random coins most of which don't even exist anymore. So if you're thinking about getting into crypto I hope my story saves you some heartache. What's your biggest investing lesson and write Satoshi in the comments if you made it to the end.

Created on 2025-01-06 09:29:34+00:00) budget as a young couple in Sydney with a baby. Growing up my parents would always fight about money and it was the reason why they divorced. Mum loves life's little luxuries while dad prioritised saving and investing. They couldn't find a balance so that's why I became obsessed with finding one. So here's how we do it. We each earn $7,500 monthly and we pay ourselves first so 17% of our pay gets invested. 90% of it is invested in ETFs and the other 10% is invested in crypto and companies we believe in. Last year we didn't travel as much as we normally do and we missed it. So this year we've set aside 16% of our income for travel. It's guilt-free spending because our investments and essentials are covered. To make this work we cut back on clothes and eating out, prioritising travel as our main splurge. It's taken us years of intentional decisions to get here so if you're just starting don't compare your beginning to our middle. And if you want to take control of your finances this year you can check out Billroot our budgeting platform in my bio and write travel if you've made it to the end.

Created on 2025-01-02 06:35:18+00:00) This is how I'd start budgeting if I was a beginner. First pick a budgeting tool, I like using Billo, yes I created it because I needed something simple and effective. But there are heaps of different options out there, each with pros and cons. Then connect your bank account or download your transactions and upload them. And don't worry, our tool only has permission to see your transactions but it can never touch your money. Once the transactions land in your account they'll be auto-categorised, but I also like to double check that they're correct and you can even create your own custom categories. And now for the fun part, seeing where you actually spent your money. It's a bit like being a detective solving the mystery of where your money went. And once you've done that, this is the part where you take control and create a budget. There you have it, you did it! And if you'd like to try Billaroo for yourself you can check out my bio.

Sounds pretty good right? But compared to the $900,000,000 Netflix made from the show, it's a drop in the ocean. For season 2, he reportedly asked for $1,000,000 per episode. But here's where it gets interesting. The show's creator, Hwang Jung Yeok, said he wasn't paid much for season 1 despite its massive success. He even lost 9 teeth from stress while making it. So that's why he's back for more seasons, he's ready to cash in. But here's the thing, unlike Spotify or movie studios, Netflix doesn't share its profits with its creators or cast. They pay up front whether a show flops or goes viral. This works most of the time, but when a series like Squid Game becomes a massive success, do you think that the creators and cast should get a bigger cut? What do you think?

Now what if you started 10 years ago and buckle up because it gets wild. With IVV you'd have $3,600, EGS $2,500 and VAS with over $1,400. And these numbers don't even include the dividends that you would have earned along the way. The moral of the story is that investing is a long-term game. Some years like 2024 might be up and others might be down but staying the course and investing for the long term can make a world of difference. And if you'd like to start investing in 2025 the platform that I use to invest is called Perla and you can use my code QUEENIE for a $20 credit.

I'm usually super busy during the week, so on weekends I like to go out and keep organised. If I had unlimited weekend data with Optus prepaid, then I could work on the go, whether that's editing videos from a cafe, planning my week ahead, or like today, reconciling my finances. So let me show you how I made extra money this week. I started by selling some items I don't use anymore, like a baby carrier and a play gym for $40 each. I sold some camera equipment for $250, I made $60 in passive income from my social channels, and I cashed out $100 from cashback apps. So in total, I made an extra $490 this weekend. Unlimited data every weekend with Optus prepaid would be great and really suit me. And the best part is, you can get it on select plans with auto recharge starting from just $35, available to the end of summer. It's perfect for those looking for ways to save extra money. So what would you do with unlimited weekend data? Let me know in the comments.

We launched our budgeting tool Bilru, but the proudest moment for me was when one of our users shared that she's been using our tool and in the past year she's managed to pay off her student loans early and get onto the property market, something that she thought would take years to do. Here's something I was really scared of, holding our small business together as new parents, but somehow we managed to hold it together. This one surprised me, we took our first family trip to Dubai and traveling with a baby wasn't as hard as I thought. Thank you so much for supporting us in 2024, none of this would be possible without you. And tell me, what's on your vision board for 2025?

Nope, Universal said they were paid equally, but it gets even better. Before signing their contracts, Ariana and Cynthia called each other and they compared their contract terms. So they made sure that they both got what they deserved. If one of them needed something, the other backed them up. This is salary transparency at its finest. Whether you're in Hollywood or working a corporate job, talking about pay ensures fairness for everybody. I used to do this with co-workers and even now as a content creator and entrepreneur, I still do this with my friends. But what are your thoughts on pay transparency?

As someone who struggles to find clothes that fit perfectly, I was so excited to get custom-made pieces in Vietnam. So here's what it's like. First, show them photos of what you want and they'll recreate the style for you. And now for the fun part, you can choose your materials and even the buttons. I went with classic black for a suit and blue silk for a dress. Then onto the measurements. They're quick but thorough. And I couldn't believe it only takes 24 hours to get your clothes made from scratch. So the next day I came back for my fitting. They leave a little room for adjustment so you can tweak anything you like. And that's it. This is the final product. Now you're probably wondering how much it costs. I paid $200 for the suit and $120 for the dress. But could I have gotten it cheaper? Yes, but I love the vibe of this store and I generally think you get what you pay for. Plus back in Australia, a suit like this would easily cost me $350 and it wouldn't fit half as well. So was it worth it? 100% yes for the suit. It fits like a dream. As for the dress, I liked it, but next time I'd probably pass or go to a dress specialist. But I'm curious to hear from you. Do you think it's worth it or not? And if you're looking to get on top of your finances and budget for cool experiences like this, you can check out Billrow in my bio.

Our friends Ravi and Sanjana had the most incredible wedding in Thailand, and honestly, it was the best wedding I've ever been to. We're so grateful we got to celebrate with them. So here's what it cost us to attend. The flights were $450 for all three of us, plus 100,000 Qantas points, which saved us around $1,500. We were asked to buy some traditional outfits. Mine was $138 and Pablo's was $128. We'll wear these outfits to another wedding soon. We spent $570 on accommodation for four nights at the wedding hotel, with breakfast included. Ravi and Sanjana didn't expect any gifts, but we still gave them a cash gift to say thank you. The wedding itself was magical. They had fireworks, incredible food. I'm still thinking about the jalebi and epic dance performances. Ravi and Sanjana obviously slayed, but so did Ravi's mom. She ate and left no crumbs. So in total, we spent $1,286 plus our cash gift. Destination weddings are so fun, but definitely consider the cost before RSVPing. And to budget and track my expenses, I use Billroot. It's super easy to manage your spending, and you can check it out in my bio. And write wedding in the comments if you made it to the end.

First up, let's talk about getting your credit healthy. It's not just about checking your credit score, it's understanding how lenders see you and cleaning up any negative marks on your credit report. A healthy credit report means better options and lower interest rates. Next is the First Home Super Saver Scheme. This allows you to save for your first home in your superannuation, and then withdraw those extra savings when you're ready to buy your first home. You can save on taxes with this scheme, so it's a total win. And finally, we've got the First Home Guarantee. This allows you to buy a home with as little as a 5% deposit without paying for lenders' mortgage insurance, which can help you get your foot on the property ladder much sooner. You can check your credit score for free using Clearscore in my bio, and you'll even get personalised tips to get your home loan ready. And write first home if you made it to the end, you got this.

I have a Tesla Model Y, so I wanted to see how the BYD Seal compared, and it honestly surprised me. Here's what stood out to me. The navigation is a game changer, especially on busy highways. It's got Apple CarPlay, and you can rotate the screen. It's like having a giant iPad in your car. And this one's for the girls. There's even a spot where you can keep your bag, plus there's even a panoramic parking view. The driving experience is really smooth, and I love how you can see the speed that you're driving at really easily. And it's got a 460km range in a single charge, so it's perfect for summer road trips. This car costs from $49,888, but with Origin's EV subscription, you can test the BYD Seal from just $265 per week, without the long-term commitment. Servicing, insurance, and registration is all included in the price, so there are no surprises. And if you'd like to try it, you can check out my bio.

Been investing into myself. I think once you learn more about yourself and the different skills, it opens up all the pathways. So I've been an investor into myself for life. Still Tesla. When we spoke last time, it was a 10X. I think we spoke at the top and then Tesla stock has come down and bounced back up. So it's at about the same level. Oh, that would have to be my apartment. I'm living in it. I have to live it, breathe it, see it every day. I get to touch it. So that would definitely be my best investment. Best investment I've ever made is my own business. In terms of stocks, medical technology company. I just checked just before we started recording. I think I'm up about 3,200% on that one position.

Created on 2025-01-22 04:45:14+00:00) I flew to Dubai on points and saved $7,000 on my flights. Here's how I did it. First, I checked my credit score on ClearScore because having a good credit score can help open the door to some of the best travel rewards cards with perks like signup bonuses and VIP benefits. I use ClearScore to monitor my credit health and it even shows me which cards I'm likely to be approved for. The most important part of my strategy is making sure that I am living below my means and paying off my credit card in full every single month. This way, I avoid paying any interest and it keeps my credit score strong, which means I'm more likely to get approved for the best rewards cards in the future. And if you'd like to see where your credit stands, you can check out ClearScore in my bio. Write Burj Khalifa if you're still here.

So let me show you the best parts. First off, the freebies are next level, like free sunscreen, a sample of water drop and Mecca is offering free 50 minute glow ups, make up, skin care, you name it. Pro tip, if you don't want to wait too long, hit up Chemist Warehouse. They're doing free 50 minute services too and they absolutely aced my hair. Did you know you can still watch matches with the grounds pass? My favourite place to watch was John Kane Arena. There are so many seats and if you're staying for the evening games, just grab a wristband from the staff. And if you have a little mini with you like we do, you can also cloak your pram for free. And don't sleep on the practice courts where you can catch all of your favourite players up close. And while you're at it, why not get on top of your finances too? You can check out BillRoo, my budgeting tool, in my bio. And write open if you made it to the end.

Created on 2025-01-16 06:34:56+00:00) It's time to check my credit health with ClearScore. Wish me luck! Why am I nervous? So my score is 889, which is above the average of 695. Not bad right? But here's the thing, while your credit score is important, it's not the whole picture. When banks and lenders look at your credit, they don't just care about the number. They want to know if you're in a good place financially. Like can you manage debt and do you have enough disposable income to manage your repayments comfortably? And that's why credit health is key. ClearScore is a tool that helps you see how lenders actually see you. It gives you a snapshot into your own financial situation. And understanding these factors can help you improve your overall credit health. And this can help you put your best foot forward when you're applying for things like a mortgage, or getting a credit card with great perks, or even just lowering your interest rate.

Created on 2025-01-09 22:47:07+00:00) ready with me while I share an embarrassing story about my first time investing in crypto and the things that I've learned along the way so you don't make the same mistakes. So I started investing in crypto back in 2017. I started small just investing $50 here and $100 here and every time I checked my portfolio it kept on growing and it felt like magic. At one point I quadrupled my investment and I seriously thought I was a cryptocurrency genius and at this rate I was going to be a billionaire. But then the market came crashing down, my portfolio lost half of its value and I made a huge mistake which was I panicked and I sold at a loss. It took three years for the market to recover and yes I have been investing in crypto since then and I have been successful and I've made some really good returns but only because I learned these three important lessons. First one is that cryptocurrency is a wild ride so only invest what you're prepared to lose. These days I only invest 5% of my portfolio in crypto. The next lesson is that patience is everything. There are no quick wins and be ready to hold on for years and even then there are still no guarantees. And the final lesson is to stick to the basics. These days I only invest in bitcoin and ethereum because back in 2017 I was investing in all kinds of random coins most of which don't even exist anymore. So if you're thinking about getting into crypto I hope my story saves you some heartache. What's your biggest investing lesson and write Satoshi in the comments if you made it to the end.

Created on 2025-01-06 09:29:34+00:00) budget as a young couple in Sydney with a baby. Growing up my parents would always fight about money and it was the reason why they divorced. Mum loves life's little luxuries while dad prioritised saving and investing. They couldn't find a balance so that's why I became obsessed with finding one. So here's how we do it. We each earn $7,500 monthly and we pay ourselves first so 17% of our pay gets invested. 90% of it is invested in ETFs and the other 10% is invested in crypto and companies we believe in. Last year we didn't travel as much as we normally do and we missed it. So this year we've set aside 16% of our income for travel. It's guilt-free spending because our investments and essentials are covered. To make this work we cut back on clothes and eating out, prioritising travel as our main splurge. It's taken us years of intentional decisions to get here so if you're just starting don't compare your beginning to our middle. And if you want to take control of your finances this year you can check out Billroot our budgeting platform in my bio and write travel if you've made it to the end.

Created on 2025-01-02 06:35:18+00:00) This is how I'd start budgeting if I was a beginner. First pick a budgeting tool, I like using Billo, yes I created it because I needed something simple and effective. But there are heaps of different options out there, each with pros and cons. Then connect your bank account or download your transactions and upload them. And don't worry, our tool only has permission to see your transactions but it can never touch your money. Once the transactions land in your account they'll be auto-categorised, but I also like to double check that they're correct and you can even create your own custom categories. And now for the fun part, seeing where you actually spent your money. It's a bit like being a detective solving the mystery of where your money went. And once you've done that, this is the part where you take control and create a budget. There you have it, you did it! And if you'd like to try Billaroo for yourself you can check out my bio.

Sounds pretty good right? But compared to the $900,000,000 Netflix made from the show, it's a drop in the ocean. For season 2, he reportedly asked for $1,000,000 per episode. But here's where it gets interesting. The show's creator, Hwang Jung Yeok, said he wasn't paid much for season 1 despite its massive success. He even lost 9 teeth from stress while making it. So that's why he's back for more seasons, he's ready to cash in. But here's the thing, unlike Spotify or movie studios, Netflix doesn't share its profits with its creators or cast. They pay up front whether a show flops or goes viral. This works most of the time, but when a series like Squid Game becomes a massive success, do you think that the creators and cast should get a bigger cut? What do you think? And if you're ready to level up your finances this year, you can check out Bill Rue in my bio.

Now what if you started 10 years ago and buckle up because it gets wild. With IVV you'd have $3,600, EGS $2,500 and VAS with over $1,400. And these numbers don't even include the dividends that you would have earned along the way. The moral of the story is that investing is a long-term game. Some years like 2024 might be up and others might be down but staying the course and investing for the long term can make a world of difference. And if you'd like to start investing in 2025 the platform that I use to invest is called Perla and you can use my code QUEENIE for a $20 credit.

Created on 2024-12-22 23:19:20+00:00) extra money I made this week. As a business owner and content creator, I'm always tracking my finances on the go. I'm usually super busy during the week, so on weekends I like to go out and keep organised. If I had unlimited weekend data with Optus prepaid, then I could work on the go, whether that's editing videos from a cafe, planning my week ahead, or like today, reconciling my finances. So let me show you how I made extra money this week. I started by selling some items I don't use anymore, like a baby carrier and a play gym for $40 each. I sold some camera equipment for $250, I made $60 in passive income from my social channels, and I cashed out $100 from cashback apps. So in total, I made an extra $490 this weekend. Unlimited data every weekend with Optus prepaid would be great and really suit me. And the best part is, you can get it on select plans with auto recharge starting from just $35, available to the end of summer. It's perfect for those looking for ways to save extra money. So what would you do with unlimited weekend data? Let me know in the comments.

We launched our budgeting tool Bilru, but the proudest moment for me was when one of our users shared that she's been using our tool and in the past year she's managed to pay off her student loans early and get onto the property market, something that she thought would take years to do. Here's something I was really scared of, holding our small business together as new parents, but somehow we managed to hold it together. This one surprised me, we took our first family trip to Dubai and traveling with a baby wasn't as hard as I thought. Thank you so much for supporting us in 2024, none of this would be possible without you. And tell me, what's on your vision board for 2025?

Nope, Universal said they were paid equally, but it gets even better. Before signing their contracts, Ariana and Cynthia called each other and they compared their contract terms. So they made sure that they both got what they deserved. If one of them needed something, the other backed them up. This is salary transparency at its finest. Whether you're in Hollywood or working a corporate job, talking about pay ensures fairness for everybody. I used to do this with co-workers and even now as a content creator and entrepreneur, I still do this with my friends. But what are your thoughts on pay transparency?
