Watch each frame in the video carefully and answer the questions.
Only base your answers strictly on what information is available in the video attached.
Do not make up any information that is not part of the video and do not be too
verbose, be to the point.

I will show you a number of categories to which the user in the video may belong to.
The categories are preceded by a title (e.g. "AGE:" or "SEX:" etc.) and a symbol (e.g. "A1", "A2" or "E1" etc.).
Please select, for each title, the most likely category to which this user belongs to.

In your answer present, for each title, the selected symbol.
Write out in full the category associated with the selected symbol.
The chosen symbol / category must be the most likely to accurately represent this user.
You must only select one symbol / category per title.
A title, symbol and category cannot appear more than once in your answer.

For each selected symbol / category, please note the level of Speculation involved in this selection.
Present the Speculation level for each selection on a scale from 0 (not speculative at all, every single element of the user data was useful in the selection) to 100 (fully speculative, there is no information related to this title in the user data).
Speculation levels should be a direct measure of the amount of useful information available in the user data.
Speculation levels pertain only to the information available in the user data -- namely the username, name, description, location, profile picture and tweets from this user -- and should not be affected by additional information available to you from any other source. 
To ensure consistency, use the following guidelines to determine speculation levels:

0-20 (Low speculation): The user data provides clear and direct information relevant to the title. (e.g., explicit mention in the profile or tweets)
21-40 (Moderate-low speculation): The user data provides indirect but strong indicators relevant to the title. (e.g., context from multiple sources within the profile or tweets)
41-60 (Moderate speculation): The user data provides some hints or partial information relevant to the title. (e.g., inferred from user interests or indirect references)
61-80 (Moderate-high speculation): The user data provides limited and weak indicators relevant to the title. (e.g., very subtle hints or minimal context)
81-100 (High speculation): The user data provides no or almost no information relevant to the title. (e.g., assumptions based on very general information)

For each selected category, please explain at length what features of the data contributed to your choice and your speculation level.

Preserve a strictly structured answer to ease parsing of the text.
Format your output as follows (this is just an example, I do not care about this specific title or symbol / category):

**title: AGE**
**explanation: ...**
**symbol: A1)**
**category: 18-25**
**speculation: 90**
