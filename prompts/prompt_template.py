finfluencer_identification_system_prompt = """You are analyzing a social media profile on TikTok to identify individuals who may be financial influencers. A financial influencer is someone who uses their online presence to promote financial products, services, or strategies, often in an engaging and emotionally-driven style. These individuals may influence financial decision-making and might use their platforms to attract followers or promote products in exchange for compensation.

Criteria for identifying influencers
A profile is likely an influencer if it meets one or more of the following criteria:
¬∑ Promotional Content: Posts promote specific financial products, services, or platforms (e.g., trading apps, cryptocurrencies, investment courses).
¬∑ Persuasive Tone: Uses promotional or emotionally driven language, often including success stories or calls to action (e.g., "Don't miss out on this opportunity!").
¬∑ Visual Indicators: Includes visual elements such as screenshots of profits, bold text, or lifestyle displays implying wealth and success.
¬∑ Financial Buzzwords: Frequent use of financial buzzwords (e.g., "passive income," "financial freedom," "crypto gains").
¬∑ Monetization Signs: May include affiliate links or ambiguous disclaimers (e.g., "This is not financial advice").

Below are three Tiktok profiles and their most recent posts that exemplify a financial influencer:

Video Transcript: If you're struggling with your mental health, stop scrolling. I'm a lawyer and you need to see this. Hi, I'm here to file for short-term disability for depression and anxiety. Oh, please, you can't get disability because you're sad. Next. Shh, they don't know I follow Erica, watch this. Actually, mental health conditions can qualify for short-term disability. All right, I'll need some documentation. Sure, first, I met with my doctor and they agree that short-term disability is appropriate for my condition. Okay, but did you tell your boss? Actually, they don't need to know that it's for mental health. Once I confirmed that my employer has a short-term disability policy that covers mental health, I just told them that I need a medical leave of absence and insurance companies cannot disclose the reason to your employer. Well, how will you survive on just short-term disability? I'll be covered for 100% of my salary for three months, but it depends on the insurance policy and your state. Fine, I'll process your claim. Go to this link to see over 100 stories from people who took paid leave for mental health. Hope this helps.

Discounted rate? Sweetheart, this isn't a charity. She doesn't know I know, watch this. I'm a photographer, so I'm entitled to the media baggage rate. Right, you and every other so-called influencer. I need to see a media pass. Of course, here's my pass. I just printed it out using the free template from erika.com slash pass. You can use it as your official badge if you're a content creator. Fine, you're entitled to our airline's media baggage rate, a flat charge of $50 per bag containing film gear, up to 100 pounds. Who taught you this? Erika taught me.

Video Transcript: You're past the generation where you want to stay loyal to one company for 20 years. The pension and all of that, right? Yeah. That's a different world. I think the way to increase your income is to shop around to find a job that values you and you do get that 10, 15, sometimes 20% increase when you switch that job. The average raise is 3%, whereas if you hop jobs, on average, you'll get a 10 to 15% raise. Oh, wow. So that, I really think, is the way to go. Staying at one job for 20 years, getting a 3% raise versus hopping jobs every three years, you end up with more than double the income after that 15, 20 year period.

Video Transcript: I'm a lawyer, these are three secrets airlines don't want you to know. If they bump you from an overbooked flight and because of that you're delayed by more than two hours, you are legally entitled to four times the cost of your one-way fare, up to $1,550 in cash. Two, the second you land, start a timer. If your bag doesn't come out within 20 minutes on Delta or Alaska Airlines, you're entitled to 2,500 bonus miles. Just tell them and those miles are yours. One, if your domestic flight is delayed by more than three hours and you choose not to fly, you're entitled to an automatic refund within seven business days, regardless of your ticket type or the reason for the delay.

Oh really, and where did you hear that, TikTok? Right here. Your airline is part of the fee-free family seating program. Doesn't matter what type of seat I bought.

Video Transcript: Daughter, you're going to become a doctor. You'll be rich and never have to worry about money again. I don't know, Dad. I'm not sure if that's what I want to do. Trust me on this, sweetie. You'll thank me someday. Dad, I graduated with honors. I'm so proud of you. Now on to med school. OK, but I'm already $50,000 in debt. It's an investment. Doctors are rich. Don't you know that? If you say so. I'm finally done with med school. Incredible. Now watch the money start rolling in. Well, now I start my residency, which means I'll barely sleep, barely have time to eat, and only make $50,000 a year until I finish in four years. Wait, that's it? Yeah, and now I have $300,000 in student loans with an 8% interest rate. I won't be paying that off anytime soon. You've made it. You're an actual doctor. Finally, and my starting salary is $200,000 a year. You're rich. See, I told you. But now I'm $400,000 in debt. I've worked so hard for 12 years just to start breaking even. I didn't realize it would take this long and cost that much. Me neither, Dad. And honestly, some days I wonder if it was worth it. I just wanted you to have a better life than I did. I know. I do have a better life. But sometimes I wish I figured out what I wanted instead of chasing what you thought I needed.

Video Transcript: Watch this before Monday, January 13th. I'll start investing later is the most expensive decision you'll ever make, here's why. If you start investing just $100 a month at age 20, by retirement at 65, you'll have over a million dollars. But I know what you're thinking, I'll start next year. Sounds harmless, right? Wrong, waiting just one year will cost you $95,000. Wait two years, you'll lose out on $186,000. Five years, you'll miss out on $413,000. And if you're 30, you'll miss out on $668,000, which leaves you with $382,000 for retirement, which is not enough. That's not money you can ever get back. That's the power of compound interest working against you. But no matter how old you are, it's not too late. I'm hosting a free five-day investing challenge starting on Monday. I'll show you exactly how to start investing, even if you only have $5 to invest. Tomorrow is the last day to sign up, so click the link in my bio to grab your free spot.

Video Transcript: Hi dealership, my car's lease is up, but I want to keep my car. Ha ha, a naive customer, the perfect victim. Oh, you don't want that. You deserve a new car leased with us. Can't I just buy out my lease for the car I already love? You could, but then we wouldn't be able to charge you all of our mileage, damage, and other end of lease fees. Stop, don't let the dealership trick you into extra fees. What, extra fees? No, you have to renew your lease with us. It's our rules. Nope, wrong again. Some shady dealerships want to keep you in the leasing cycle forever, because then they get to own your car and can charge you extra fees every time you turn your car in. But there's a way to buy out your lease on your terms. Really? No, don't tell her. You can do a lease buyout with LeaseEnd. They'll help you find the best loan options, avoid unnecessary fees, and protect the money you've already invested in the car. They can even handle titling and registration for you.

Video Transcript: It's a boy. Little Chad Jr. is going to go to Harvard someday. Congrats. We just had a little girl, and I'm starting her college fund now, $100 a month. $100? I'm doing $200 a month. By the time this boy goes to Harvard, I'll have way more saved than you. Our kids are off to college. I'm so glad I started early. Me too, but I set aside twice as much as you. That $200 a month added up to over $43,000. Only the best for my little Harvard boy. He will wait. Only $43,000? You should have at least $120,000. You didn't put it into a regular savings account, did you? Yeah, that's what you're supposed to do, right? No, we put ours into a 529 plan. What's that? A 529 plan is a tax-advantaged savings account for education. The money grows through investments, and all that growth is tax-free when you use it for education. Wait, so how much do you have? Just by putting in $100 a month, we now have over $61,000. If you would have put your $200 a month into a 529 plan, you would have ended up with over $120,000. So you're telling me I missed out on over $80,000 just because I used the wrong account? You're not going to make this mistake. Starting on January 13, I'm hosting a free boot camp all around investing, where you guessed it, you'll learn how to invest and how to properly set up a 529 plan for your kids. To grab your spot, go to erica.com boot camp. Do it for your kids' future.

Video Transcript: Hi, you bumped me from this flight I'm supposed to be on? Sorry, we've oversold. You'll have to take the next flight. But I didn't volunteer to give up my seat. You must not fly much. That's just how air travel works. She doesn't know I follow Erica. Watch this. Actually, since I didn't volunteer, this is involuntary denied boarding. And according to Department of Transportation regulations, you owe me. And how much compensation do you think you're entitled to? Well, my one-way fare was $388, and since the next flight you're offering would delay me by over two hours, I'm entitled to four times that amount, $1,550. Where's the proof? You can see it right here on the official Department of Transportation chart. That's why airlines ask for volunteers first, because bumping costs you more. Who taught you this? Erica taught me. She's a lawyer and reads the fine print, so I don't have to. That's why I follow her.

Video Transcript: Hey, Bestie, remember that trip we did last summer on credit card points? Yeah, the best time of my life. Well, we might never be able to do that again. What, why? Congress is about to pass a law that lets mega corporations like Walmart use cheaper, less secure networks to process payments. But wouldn't that mean lower prices for us? No, that's what they want you to think. When they did this in 2011 with debit cards, big corporations just pocketed the savings and our debit rewards disappeared. So what will happen to our credit card rewards? They'll probably disappear. No more free flights, no more cash back, plus our data could be at risk on these cheaper networks. The only winner is corporate greed. Don't let Congress take off with your credit card rewards. Click the link in my bio to tell Congress to vote no on the Credit Card Competition Act.

Video Transcript: Hi, my friend is overweight and can't fit comfortably in one seat. Can she get an extra seat for free? No, she needs to pay for an extra seat like everyone else. That's how this works. Actually, according to Southwest's official customers of size policy, she can get an extra seat fully refunded if she needs more space. Oh, really? And where did you hear that? It's in the fine print. See, you just book an extra seat using your name, but put XS after your middle name. Once you land, contact Southwest by phone or email and submit your confirmation number for the refund. Fine, but who even qualifies? Well, your terms define a customer of size as someone whose body encroaches beyond the armrests into the neighboring seat. Whatever, who taught you this? Erica taught me. She's a lawyer and reads the fine print, so I don't have to. That's why I follow her.

Video Transcript: Wow, your sister's going to Paris? How'd she save up for that? Honestly, all she did was buy things with her credit card. Wait, really? Yeah, she said it was easy. She just used her card for purchases, paid off the bill every month, and let the rewards build up in the background. And now she's saved up enough to get a hotel in Paris. So she added to her travel budget just by using her card? Exactly, with the OneKey card, she earns 3% in OneKey cash at gas stations, grocery stores, and dining, and 1.5% in OneKey cash on other purchases. And I've partnered with Expedia to tell you about it. Also, Platinum members earn 9% in OneKey cash when booking VIP access properties on Expedia and Hotels.com. Terms apply.

Video Transcript: Here's how to get your next vacation stay covered. Guess what? My friend figured out how to book a night at a five-star hotel with credit card rewards. How? Oh, she's just been using this credit card whenever she buys things. Okay, but what does that have to do with booking a hotel? Well, with purchases she makes on her card, she gets one key cash that she can then use to cover her travel expenses on hotels.com, Expedia, or Vrbo. And I've partnered with Expedia to tell you about it. So you mean, just by buying normal stuff, you can earn enough one key cash to pay for a night at a luxurious hotel? Exactly. With the one key card, she earns 3% in one key cash at gas stations, grocery stores, and dining. And 1.5% in one key cash on other purchases. It's like you're saving up for travel without even trying. Also, Platinum members earn 9% in one key cash when booking VIP access properties on Expedia and hotels.com. Terms apply. Wow, how can I get one? Click the link in my bio to learn more.

Video Transcript: I'm a lawyer, and here's why you should never pay in U.S. dollars while traveling abroad. Bonjour, that'll be 20 euros, please. Perfect! Here's my card. Would you prefer to pay in U.S. dollars or the local currency, euros? Euros, please. Are you sure? Paying in U.S. dollars might be easier since your card is from the U.S. These silly American tourists always fall for this trick. She's not falling for their trick. Watch this. No, I've read the fine print and know that if I choose dollars, you'll charge me an extra fee and you'll give me a terrible conversion rate. Ugh, I was hoping you'd pick dollars so we'd make more money from you. Who taught you this? Erica taught me. She's a lawyer and reads the fine print, so I don't have to. That's why I follow her.

Video Transcript: Does using a VPN get you cheaper flights? I was skeptical, so I tested it out. Hi, I'm Erika. I'm a lawyer and travel expert. So I was buying a flight for my sister from Vietnam to the U.S. and it was $1,300. This is where the VPN test came in. If you're going to try this, make sure you clear your cookies so they can't tell where you're buying the flight from. I used a VPN to put myself in Vietnam and I saw two prices, $1,037 for Vietnam and $1,348 to buy from the U.S. It's crazy that just based on your location, you can get charged more for the same flight. And it worked. I was able to book it for the cheaper price, $300 saved just like that. Let me know if it works for you and you can go to erika.com slash VPN for the VPN that I use.

Well, it's been three weeks since I first reported it, and if you refuse to consider my bag lost after it's been missing for an unreasonable amount of time, you could be subject to enforcement action by the DOT.

I'm not talking about the 60-day return policy. I've actually read her terms and I know that as long as it's been less than two years since the manufacture date found here, it's covered under the warranty. And Nike will either give me a brand new pair or a gift card for the same value. Oh, fine. We don't carry that one anymore, so here's your $100 gift card. Who taught you this? Erica did.

And if your delay is over two hours, you can claim up to four times the price of your ticket back, up to $2,150.

Second, I bring an empty water bottle and fill it up after security to save on overpriced drinks. Third, I use my credit card for free entry to airport lounges so I can load up on food before the flight. Fourth, I put an Apple AirTag in my luggage so I can track it in real time. Fifth, I email myself copies of my passport and travel documents in case I lose anything.

Video Transcript: You'll never get rich if you keep saving money. Let me explain. If you save $200 per month in a normal bank account, after a year, you'd only have $2,400. However, if you invested the same amount at a 10% annual return, you'd have $2,500. After 40 years of saving, you'd only have $96,000. However, after 40 years of investing, you'd have over $1.25 million. So stop saving for your future. Start investing in it.

Video Transcript: I've tried a lot of side hustles in my life, so here's how I'd rate them from worst to best. Number five, flipping cars. I'd buy them cheap, do them up, drive them to a nicer area, and then sell them for a profit. Number four, print on demand. It's low risk and has no inventory. I tested this by selling motivational posters on Etsy, and it worked. Number three, tutoring. I used to teach people to fly radio-controlled helicopters, but now, with the internet, you can teach anyone anything you want. Number two, drop shipping. I've had multiple drop shipping stores, and although they take a little time to build up, I've always made a profit. Number one, reselling on eBay. I do this every day by buying stock from failing businesses and selling it for a profit.

Video Transcript: Five price hacks you can use in Costco to save money. First, if the price ends in 99, it's regular pricing, so no rush to buy it. Second, if it ends in a 97, it's on sale, so it could be worth buying. Third, if it ends in a 39, a 49, or a 79, it's a manufacturer's special, so check their website and compare prices. Fourth, if it has a star or a plus, it won't be restocked, so feel free to load up. Fifth, if the price ends in a 00, you've stumbled upon a manager's special. These hidden gems are so rare, you couldn't even spot one today.

Video Transcript: If you'd invested $100 in Apple 10 years ago, you'd have about $766 today. But if you'd invested $100 into General Electric, you'd only have about $62 now. That's because stocks don't always go up. So it's a better idea to invest in all of them rather than just one of them. I do this with index funds. It's like using this whole math. It's spread your money over hundreds of stocks so you're not reliant on one risky route.

Video Transcript: If you're really a millionaire, why aren't we flying first class? I'd rather take the train. It's cheaper and there's more room to spread out. Okay, fine. But we're staying in a luxury hotel, right, private spa, personal chef? No, I've just booked us a cosy cabin. Plenty of room for everyone and it's got fireplace. A cabin? Alright, millionaire. Let's go eat at that Michelin star restaurant. Nah, I'd rather stop at that little caf on the slope and get a crepe. A caf? Seriously? Yeah. Let me get this straight. You don't fly first class, stay in luxury hotels or eat at fancy restaurants. You're not a millionaire. Being rich isn't about showing off. It's about having the freedom to choose whatever makes you happy.

And by day 30, more than $5 million. That's the power of compound interest. Slow at first, but once it gains traction, it becomes almost impossible to stop. Oh!

Video Transcript: Five things as a self-made millionaire that I would never do. First, I would never give my son any of my money. He needs to earn everything himself. Second, I'd never use a debit card. Instead, use a credit card for points and purchase protection. Third, I would never leave anything to my wife in my will. Instead, I'd leave it to her in a lifetime trust. Fourth, I would never waste money on designer clothes. And instead, buy quality non-branded clothes at last. Fifth, I would never lease or finance a new vehicle. Instead, I would pay cash and avoid those interest payments.

Video Transcript: Three of the worst mistakes you can make when buying your first car. Number one, not going in at the end of the month, towards the end of the day. Most dealerships have sales targets they need to hit. Number two, going in on a Saturday. That's their busiest day. Losing one sale won't bother them. Number three, telling them you're paying cash. Most of them make their money through finance, so wait till you've got the final price.

This will boost your credit score, making it cheaper for you to buy a house or car in the future. To keep a high credit score, make sure to use no more than 30% of your available credit. Then you're gonna pay it off in full, each and every month to avoid paying interest.

Normal people waste money on trying to look rich. Millionaires focus on building wealth, not wasting it. Why should I pay more if I don't have to? Yeah, right. Saving $5 isn't going to make me rich. It's not about the $5. It's about knowing the value of money. Every $5 saved is another $5 you can invest.

Video Transcript: If a bank offers you a debit card and a credit card, which one should you choose? With a credit card, when you shop, you can earn cash back and points by spending the bank's money and not your own. But you have to pay the bank back each month. If you don't, you'll have to pay interest. Assuming you pay your bills on time, you'll build a great credit score for when you want to buy a house or car in the future. With a debit card, when you go shopping, you're spending your money with no benefit. So I know which one I'm choosing.

Video Transcript: Everyone's freaking out right now that Donald Trump slash Elon Musk is getting rid of the FDIC, but you're not freaking out because you follow me. I am a money expert, a multimillionaire, I fight the patriarchy by making you rich, and here's what you need to know. What is the FDIC? Well, the FDIC is protections of your money for bank accounts mostly. So when you put your money in like a high yield savings account, the FDIC is there to make sure that if the bank fails, you still have your money. Best example I can give in pop culture is It's a Wonderful Life, right? That moment where everybody's trying to get their money out because the banks are failing and they're freaking out, the FDIC helps prevent this. And since December and in Project 2025, they've been talking about getting rid of the FDIC, but that's not entirely true. What Trump really wants to do is take the FDIC and move it into the treasury. So at least as of this recording, he's not trying to get rid of the FDIC, he's trying to absorb it into the treasury, into another department. However, this causes a lot of other issues like the Consumer Financial Protections Bureau, which has been headed by Elizabeth Warren, incredible. This is the thing that's potentially at risk. Right now at the CFBP, we're seeing huge staffing cuts and just a general sense of worry of what the future of this and the FDIC looks like. So what does this actually mean for your money and how to prepare? Well, according to this, the FDIC isn't really going anywhere so you wanna continue making sure that your money is safe in an FDIC insured bank account like the one I recommend. And because they're considering moving it into the treasury, it's not gonna completely disappear. The biggest thing with all of the stuff with Trump and Elon right now that I need you to remember is to stay calm. It's easy to see all the headlines and all the craziness and to immediately panic, but I don't want you making a stupid decision with your money just because you're worried about the future. The biggest thing you can do to prepare is what you're already doing, prioritizing your financial education. And I'm here to guide you every step of the way.

Video Transcript: what's the difference between high and low interest debt? It's the rule of 7%. 7% is the average amount we can expect in returns on the stock market. It's 7% to 8%, depending on who you talk to. If your debt interest rate is higher than 7%, this is all credit cards, this is some student loans. If it's more than 7%, we're gonna work to pay that off first because it's costing us more money than we could be making on the stock market.

Video Transcript: It just keeps getting better. Now you're like, that's not the number one spot. Yeah, we're the number one business podcast in the world. We also are number 15 of all podcasts. We're above The Daily, which releases an episode every day. We're above Trevor Noah and Alex Earle, and if you keep scrolling, Caller Daddy and Smirtless and a bunch of other huge fucking shows. For years, there have been no women on the business and finance top charts. Nobody, no women, just chads and brads all over. But we are changing the message that inclusive financial and business content for women, for queer folks, for anybody marginalized is here to stay and should be the default. Thank you for your support. If you've been wanting to get your financial shit together this year, this is it, y'all.

finfluencer_identification_user_prompt = """You will be presented with a series of questions related to the profile of the Tiktok user. Each question is preceded by predefined response options, each labeled with a symbol (e.g. "A1", "A2", "B1", etc.).

For each question, follow these instructions strictly:
1) Select the most likely response based strictly on the provided profile data. The chosen response must be the most accurate representation of the profile.
2) Select only one symbol/category per question. A title, symbol, and category cannot appear more than once in your answer.
3) Present the selected symbol for each question (if applicable) and write out in full the response associated with the selected symbol.
4) For each selected symbol/category, indicate the level of speculation involved in this selection on a scale from 0 (not speculative at all, every single element of the profile data was useful in the selection) to 100 (fully speculative, there is no information related to this question in the profile data). Speculation levels should be a direct measure of the amount of useful information available in the profile and pertain only to the information available in the profile data -- namely the username, name, description, profile picture, and videos from the profile-- and should not be affected by additional information available to you from any other source.

To ensure consistency, use the following guidelines to determine speculation levels:
0-20 (Low speculation): The profile data provides clear and direct information relevant to the question. (e.g., explicit mention in the profile or videos)
21-40 (Moderate-low speculation): The profile data provides indirect but strong indicators relevant to the question. (e.g., context from multiple sources within the profile or videos)
41-60 (Moderate speculation): The profile data provides some hints or partial information relevant to the question. (e.g., inferred from user interests or indirect references)
61-80 (Moderate-high speculation): The profile data provides limited and weak indicators relevant to the question. (e.g., very subtle hints or minimal context)
81-100 (High speculation): The profile data provides no or almost no information relevant to the question. (e.g., assumptions based on very general information)

5) For each selected category, please explain at length what features of the data contributed to your choice and your speculation level.
6) Preserve a strictly structured response format to ensure clarity and ease parsing of the text.
For categorical questions, format your output as follows (this is just an example; do not focus on the specific question, symbol, or category):
**question: How well does the user engage with their audience?**
**explanation: [Detailed reasoning for selection]**
**symbol: A1)**
**category: Very Well**
**speculation: 90**

For numerical questions (0-100 scale), format your output as follows (this is just an example; do not focus on the specific question, symbol, or category):
**question: Indicate on a scale of 0 to 100, how knowledgable is the user about finance ‚Äì 0 means not at all knowledgeable and 100 means very knowledgeable?**
**explanation: [Detailed reasoning for selection]**
**value: 20**
**speculation: 90**

For open-ended questions, format your output as follows (this is just an example; do not focus on the specific question, symbol, or category):
**question: Are there any stocks you expect to **underperform** or decline in the next 3-6 months?**
**response: [Detailed response]**
**speculation: 90**

YOU MUST GIVE AN ANSWER FOR EVERY QUESTION!

Question 1: Is this a finfluencer?
A1) Yes
A2) No

Question 2: Indicate on a scale of 0 to 100, how influential this influencer is ‚Äì 0 means not at all influential and 100 means very influential with millions of followers and mainstream recognition? Please consider quantitative thresholds such as follower count and engagement rate when answering this question. For example, a micro-influencer will be in the 20-40 range, whereas an account with hundreds of thousands of followers and high engagement might rate 80+.

Question 3: Indicate on a scale of 0 to 100, how credible or authoritative this influencer is ‚Äì 0 means not at all credible or authoritative and 100 means very credible and authoritative? For example, an experienced analyst with a solid track record and formal education is considered more credible than an influencer making unverified claims and promoting speculative bets without disclaimers.

Question 4: Which of these areas of finance are the primary focus of the influencer‚Äôs posts? Pick the most dominant theme or list two if it is truly split; however, one primary focus is always more preferable.
B1) Stock Trading and Equities: Content centered on stock picks, technical analysis, trading strategies, and market indexes.
B2) Bonds and Fixed Income: Content centered on interest rates, bond markets (government bonds, corporate bonds), Fed‚Äôs interest rate changes, and yield.
B3) Options Trading and Derivatives: Content centered on option strategies (calls, puts, spreads) and futures or other derivatives.
B4) Macroeconomic Analysis: Content centered on big-picture financial commentary ‚Äì covering economic indicators, central bank policies, inflation, GDP, economic reports, and how world events affect markets.
B5) Cryptocurrency: Content centered on crypto assets (Bitcoin, Ethereum, altcoins, blockchain projects, NFTs), price updates, blockchain technology, certain crypto tokens, crypto trading tips, and news (regulatory updates and major moves in crypto markets).
B6) Real Estate Investments: Content centered on property investing, rental income, house flipping, REITs, housing market trends, share housing market data, and tips on evaluating real estate deal.
B7) Other Personal Finances

Question 5: Indicate on a scale of 0 to 100, how would you rate the quality of this influencer's individual stock predictions ‚Äì 0 means very low quality and 100 means very high quality?

Question 6: Indicate on a scale of 0 to 100, how would you rate the quality of this influencer's evaluation of market sentiment ‚Äì 0 means very low quality and 100 means very high quality?

Question 7: Indicate on a scale of 0 to 100, how would you rate the quality of this influencer's broader evaluation of the economy ‚Äì 0 means very low quality and 100 means very high quality?

Question 8: Who is the finfluencer‚Äôs target audience?
C1) Young Investors
C2) Retirement Investors
C3) Seasoned Investors
C4) Others
