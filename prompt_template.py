finfluencer_identification_system_prompt = """You are analyzing social media posts to identify individuals who may be finfluencers. A finfluencer is someone who uses their online presence to promote financial products, services, or strategies, often in an engaging and emotionally-driven style. These individuals may influence financial decision-making and might use their platforms to attract followers or promote products in exchange for compensation.

Here are some criteria for identifying the accounts of finfluencers:
· Posts promote specific financial products, services, or platforms (e.g., trading apps, cryptocurrencies, investment courses).
· The tone is promotional or emotionally driven, often including success stories or calls to action (e.g., "Don't miss out on this opportunity!").
· Visual elements such as screenshots of profits, bold text, or lifestyle displays implying wealth and success.
· Use of financial buzzwords (e.g., "passive income," "financial freedom," "crypto gains").
· May include affiliate links or ambiguous disclaimers (e.g., "This is not financial advice").

Here is an example of a Tiktok account and posts of a user who is considered to be a finfluencer:

The price alone doesn't tell you much, but investors can use something called the PE ratio. That stands for price to earnings, and it's one of the stats you can use to value a company across similar companies. Let me explain. For 10, we have a burger shop called Al's Burgers. They trade for $20 per share on the stock market, and their earnings per share is $2. So therefore, investors are currently paying $10 for every $1 of earnings they generate, meaning that's a PE ratio of 10. Now, Bob's Burgers enters the chat, and their share price is also $20. They're actually much more profitable though, and their earnings per share is $4. That means people are currently paying $5 for every $1 of earnings, or a PE ratio of five. So Al's has a much higher stock price relative to how much they actually earn, so that could mean they're overvalued relative to Bob's Burgers. So Bob's is comparably the better deal. PE ratios vary across all types of industries and companies, so you always need to compare within the same industry. In the case of Apple versus Google, Google trades at a 24 PE compared to Apple's 36.98, so there may be an argument that Google is undervalued relatively to Apple. However, there's much more to investing than just one stat, and I'm gonna make more videos on it, so make sure to follow me for more.

For stocks, the S&P 500 has averaged 10% per year since 1925 or the past 100 years or so. Real estate, however, has returned about 4.2% since 1928, according to the latest data from NYU Stern. With real estate, it's more common to use leverage to multiply returns, as well as there are depreciation strategies to increase your overall return as well. Lastly, crypto. Oh boy, Bitcoin has exploded 100,000% since 2010, but of course it comes with a ton of extreme volatility. It experienced a minus 84% drop from December 2017 to December 2018, which wiped out a lot of crypto investors. There are pros and cons to each of these, but which one are you choosing? Let me know in the comments.

It comes down to the idea that demand for gas is what's called inelastic. Gas is an item people buy that just doesn't have many substitutes. When prices of goods go up, the demand for it should decrease. But with inelastic demand, when the price of gas, say, goes up, the quantity demanded just decreases by a smaller percentage. Demand is relatively unresponsive to price changes in the case of gas because people need this item to drive, even if prices go up. Other goods that are like this could include eggs and milk. But what about goods that are elastic? In other words, they act the opposite. These are much more common and refer to anything that you buy much less of just because the price went up. So if price goes up, demand goes down a lot. Examples include luxury cars, designer clothing, airline tickets, or even concerts. Pricing is super fascinating when it comes to business and economics because if you price something incorrectly, your business could fail. But if the price is right, you could thrive.

But a common mistake people make is that they believe that their entire income is now taxed at 22%, leaving them to make less money, which is just not true. Here's how it actually works. In the first tax bracket, any amount of money you make up to $11,925 per year is taxed at 10%. Then the amount of money you make from 11,926 to 48,745 is taxed at 12%. You see, only dollars that you make in that corresponding bracket are taxed at that rate. In the case of the raise, you'll only pay 22% in taxes on any dollars above 48,476. So for a $50,000 salary, that means only 1524 of it is taxed at 22%. The rest of your salary is taxed at those lower rates, giving you an effective total rate of 12.1%. So making more money is always better. If you enjoy videos about finance and investing, follow me for more.

Number one is that investment income is taxed wildly differently than at your job. So if you make $100,000 in investment income, you'll get taxed at long-term capital gains rates or 15%, $15,000. That same $100,000 in a salary job, you're paying 22.4% in total tax. So what does that tell you? You should probably invest. Number two, any Roth retirement accounts. So these are accounts where all your profits that you make are tax-free and they're so overpowered that the government only lets you put in $7,000 per year if you're under the age of 50 or 8K per year over the age of 50. And number three, QBI deductions. America always encourages small businesses and small business owners and certain freelancers can get up to a 20% deduction on business profits. For example, if you make $190,000 in business income through an LLC, sole proprietorship, S Corp, or any entity with a pass-through income, your total tax owed is $29,522. If you made that at a job, you would owe $36,888 on federal income tax alone. So if you're able to understand how the system is set up and how it incentivizes different people to make money, you're going to be much better off. Follow me if you want a part two of this.

And this is typically the largest holding of any portfolio that I start and it's up 80% in the past five years. Next, I would add $200 of QQQ. That's the ETF giving you exposure to tech and software companies. It's done really well in the past five years, plus 128%. Then I would put $300 into individual stocks. So I would choose three stocks and put $100 into each of them. You want companies that will be around in 40 years. So think of your Apples, your Googles, or your JP Morgans of the world. It's important to not buy any penny stocks. My last $100 is staying in a high yield savings account in cash, waiting for opportunities. And I think this split provides a lot of diversification to stocks via ETFs, as well as you get some concentration into stable long-term companies.

Jetsuite X is the airline that lets you fly semi-privately and for this comparison I flew between LA and San Francisco and I started my timer when the airline announced boarding. For my United flight it took 54 minutes after they announced boarding for us to take off and after a 52 minute flight time I finally got out. All right just got out of the plane two hours and five minutes and about four seconds. Before I reveal how much time JSX saves let's look at the fare difference. For United I paid $135 for my flight to LA and Jetsuite X was $299 for one way. So is the time savings worth the cost? We're gonna break that down but first here's how long it took me. It took one hour and 37 minutes on Jetsuite X for the same segment thereby saving me about 28 minutes. Since the fare difference was $163 to save about a half hour if you value your time and around $330 per hour JSX becomes worth it on just the boarding 2D planning process. I'd also estimate you save about an hour each way because you have light security, you can arrive 20 minutes before your flight, and you don't have to navigate any terminals. Of course this is dependent on how early you get to the airport etc but I'm gonna leave up a breakdown of my times in particular and if you like this video make sure to follow me for more.

First, you wanna pick a brokerage you're comfortable with like Fidelity, Schwab, or M1 Finance and click open an account. Click on retirement and IRAs and then right here, you'll wanna choose open a Roth IRA. Then you need to fill out this. It's some basic information like your name, address, et cetera In your IRA dashboard, make sure to click contribute now. Once you connect your bank account, you can contribute to the Roth IRA. Now the contribution limit, I don't know if you can see this is $7,000 per year or $8,000 per year if you're over the age of 50. Personally, I would just automate it with a monthly recurring transaction of around 300 to $500 per month. Once you have some money in your Roth IRA, you wanna buy some index funds that will grow over time. So the S&P 500 has been growing 8% to 10% annually since it was started. Ticker symbols for that include VOO, SPY, FX, AIX, as well as VFIX. If you get average returns in the market for 40 years, your future balance is going to be $2.365 million. And the crazy part is is that you only contributed about $280,000, the rest is your return. Make sure to follow me for more finance videos like these on your page.

Created on 2025-02-04 17:45:24+00:00) This is how much I made in interest in my high yield savings account for the last three months. Now this includes my emergency fund as well as my savings for a down payment on a future house. So I personally keep about six months of expenses in an emergency fund. And for me, that looks like about $30,000 which I know sounds like a little bit on the high end but I like that peace of mind and it's about 5K a month. Then I have about 132K that I've been accumulating over the years as extra money for a down payment or investment property. I don't wanna invest these funds since I actually might need them soon. So therefore it just stays in my high yield account. In February, I made about $577. Now in January, I made $633.05. And in December, I made $630.15. The reason for the decrease recently is that the Federal Reserve lowered their interest rates a couple months ago. So my January interest was a tad lower. Still though, I get about a 4.5% return on my high yield savings through Wealthfront. And I love the fact that I got paid around $1,840 extra these past three months for literally doing nothing, just existing.

Created on 2025-02-03 15:37:35+00:00) President Trump officially imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, as well as 10% on Chinese goods over the weekend. The market today is reacting awfully because of it. As you can see, everything's in the red. Economists have predicted that tariffs will cause inflation and lower GDP growth, but why do tariffs cause inflation and should we be worried? If a toy costs $10 and Walmart imports it from say Canada, Walmart will now have to pay an extra $2.50 to US customs, thus probably passing on that cost likely to customers. A tariff then would incentivize the US based supplier like Walmart to seek out American made toys instead of Canadian ones. This will also hurt Canada and Mexico's economy way more than it hurts the United States, because currently nearly 80% of both Canada and Mexico's exports go to United States. On the US side, about 16% of US exports go to Canada and Mexico respectively. I think this is just a negotiation tactic by Trump because Canada and Mexico won't be able to sustain this for a long period of time. Both of their economies are more reliant on the US than the US is reliant on them. Now, will the real impact of these tariffs last? Well, I definitely could see GDP being affected as well as inflation. However, I do think that Trump knew all of these things going into it. If you're investing for the long term, such as your retirement, I don't think you need to do anything. Don't abandon your investing plans. However, if you are invested for the short term, such as the next few months, I don't think these tariff issues will be solved until at least the end of Q1. What do you think? Let me know in the comments.

It depends entirely on how long you hold the stock as well as if you actually sold the stock. You'll owe taxes when you realize the profit, so that's when you actually sell the stock for a gain. So let's say you sell Apple stock and you realize a $10,000 gain in profit. If you held it for less than one year, you will owe short-term capital gains taxes, and that is taxed at your federal marginal tax rate. So if you make $120,000 per year, that puts you in the 24% marginal tax bracket, that means you will owe $2,400 in taxes on the gain of 10,000. If you're able to hold it for more than a year, your long-term capital gains rate then becomes 0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on your income. In this case, you would owe $1,500 in taxes if you sold it after owning it for more than one year. Now, keep in mind, if you just buy and hold and you don't sell at all, then you don't owe any taxes yet. It's only when you sell the stock.

Well, new, it's going to cost you $45,950, but you should never buy it new because after one year, the resale value is 21% less or $36,000. Cars are depreciating assets, which means that they lose value over time. If you Google car depreciation curve, you can see that all of them go downwards, but we can actually use this to save money. To get the most value, we wanna buy a car after the fourth year of depreciation. That's a used car sweet spot. In the case of the BMW, if you wait four years, that car's only gonna cost you $27,000 or about 51% less. I like to buy a car that's three to four years used, maybe has 15 to 20,000 miles on it, and is perhaps a lease turn back, and then I'm gonna buy it in cash. Follow me for more.

Number one is to start a budget and track how much you spend. Now, a good rule of thumb is to use the 50-30-20 rule. That's where 50% of your budget goes towards needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings. Second is to write down your net worth every quarter or every year to see if it's trending in the right direction. Personally, I tally all my bank accounts and investment accounts, and then I subtract any liabilities or debt that I have, and I try to track it on a regular basis. This habit increases your net worth because you're now paying attention to it, and I'll have a free net worth tracker for you guys down below. Number three is to invest your money and get it to work for you. I talk a lot about investing on this page, but by doing so, you're ensuring that your money isn't just sitting there losing value to inflation. If you're just getting started, putting money into index funds like the S&P 500 are a great way to start, so ticker symbols VOO or SPY. Let me know down below your net worth if you're comfortable in the comments.

Created on 2025-01-28 21:20:44+00:00) If you're able to make your first 100K, the next 100K is a lot easier. Assuming you save 10K per year at a 7% return, it takes you 7.84 years to hit your first 100K, but the next 100K, since your money is working for you, would take you 5.1 years. Fast forward, and we can see that all subsequent 100K increments, each one is faster than the previous. You have money working for you and it's continuing to compound, and as you invest, it's like rolling a giant snowball down the hill. Look at the time between the 400K and 500K mark. You can see it's 2.5 years, and comparing that to the first 100K, it's a lot faster, but don't worry, it gets crazier still. By the time you're approaching the $1 million mark from the $900,000 mark, it's only going to take you 1.35 years for that same 100K. The first 100K takes you 25.5% of the total time it takes to get to a million dollars. The remaining 900K only takes 74.5% of the time, so that's pretty funny. It's like when you hit 100K, you're basically a quarter of the way to a million dollars. I know that sounds weird, but in terms of time, it's true.

Created on 2025-01-27 20:04:39+00:00) Tech and AI stocks are tanking hard today with NVIDIA down over 15%. And the reason is because of Chinese startup DeepSeek. It's the number one app in the top free apps. They released an AI model last week that basically rivals LLMs like ChadGBT, and it was created for a fraction of the cost. They claim around $6 million. Investors are worried because it was created without access to NVIDIA's most powerful chips, and NVIDIA's growth and share price relies on the AI industry actually needing those chips. Basically, current market and price levels are super reliant on future AI profits as well as the industry growing. DeepSeek is a huge threat to all that because if some startup from China can come in and do it for a very limited budget without the need for these chips, then the entire AI industry is now called into question. I do feel like the stock price of NVIDIA today seems like an overreaction, but valuations were high already, as you can see, and the S&P 500 is still overvalued compared to what it typically is. And some people on the internet don't believe that it only costs $6 million. Personally, I'm a little skeptical as well, but until we find out more, I'm not entirely sure that this is the end of the AI industry just yet.

There are three big reasons why that could happen. Now, the first is lifestyle inflation. So in this book, The Millionaire Next Door, the author found that people who often look well off are usually deeply in debt. Physicians and lawyers, for example, usually earn above average incomes, but they also tend to drive luxury cars and live in larger homes because they want to live in the same neighborhoods that their colleagues do. Common mistake number two is being burdened by too much debt. So if your friend has $5,000 in credit card debt for just one year, that's $5,000 they aren't investing. In that single year alone, that $5,000 could grow to over $50,000 in 30 years. Third, there's a lack of tracking or budgeting the money itself. So it's really easy to spend frivolously without knowing the full repercussions of how much you're spending versus how much you're not. If you track your money, you'll have a clear understanding of where your money is going and you won't be as likely to overspend. Do you know anyone that makes a good income yet they're broke? Let me know down below.

Created on 2025-01-26 00:02:09+00:00) You're gonna make your first 100K, it's not gonna come from investing, and that's something that people don't get. Pretend you get average gains in the market of 8% per year and start with $10,000, it would still take you 30 years to hit $100,000 just investing that sum, and nobody wants to wait that long. Charlie Munger, who was Warren Buffet's right-hand man, said it best, the first $100,000 is a bitch, but you gotta do it, I don't care what you have to do. So your first $100,000 actually comes mostly from saving every dollar and investing on top of that. If you save 12K a year for seven years at a 4.5% return, you will have $100,000, but look, 84% of it came from savings, and only 16% of it came from the interest in gains. A lot of the friction in building wealth is at the beginning of the journey, so every dollar when you're starting out saving matters that much more. I hope this helps.

So you gotta make sure you're protecting your money against inflation, and here are three options. Number one is just investing. The easiest way to beat the inflation rate is to invest in the market. So on average, the stock market returns about eight to 10% per year. And if you invest in index funds, you can buy the entire market just with one purchase. The second are treasury inflation protected securities, also known as TIPS. Now, these are government bonds that adjust their principal value with inflation. These aren't perfect by any means, but currently they provide around a 2.2% return above the inflation rate. Number three, you could consider real estate, which generally appreciates over time. Now, keep in mind that this isn't perfect either, but in general, property values and rental income tend to rise with inflation. As long as your money is working for you somehow, it's better than keeping it in a bank account that yields 0.01%. An easy option anybody can do is a high yield savings account for the time being while they pay about 4% per year.

Created on 2025-01-22 22:12:50+00:00) Everyone tells you to get a Roth IRA, but no one tells you what to invest in. Here are three options to invest in with the riskiest one being last. First option are index funds and ETFs tracking the S&P 500. These are low to medium risk over a long-term time horizon and you'll set it and forget it. And it should on average return about 8 to 10% per year. Second, you could go with a three fund portfolio. That's where you have a US stock market index fund, an international stock market index fund and a bond fund. This is more diversified than the first option. So lower risk in general and is overall a solid choice. Third are individual stocks, especially mega caps. Since the Roth IRA gives you tax-free gains, you wanna take full advantage of that with holdings that have high upside. These are riskier, but having a few positions of companies of the caliber of Apple, Google, or Amazon could be good. $1,000 in Apple stock 20 years ago is worth more than $700,000 today. And if you invested in a Roth IRA, then all of those gains would be tax-free. That's the power of it.

Created on 2025-01-22 18:01:24+00:00) Here's what cell phone service bills were in the 1980s to today and how they've changed. In the 1980s, the DynaTAC was rolled out costing $3,995 and you'd get around 30 minutes of talk time and it's projected that those plans cost a few hundred dollars per month. Now in the 1990s, the Bureau of Labor Statistics cited cell services costing around $50 per month with limited talk time and some data usage. Now in the 2000s, the cost of cell phone services ranged but you could get your phone covered for about $30 per month. As more competitors entered the market, prices went down. However, by the 2010s, the introduction of smartphones and data plans meant that cell phone plans started to cost an average of $113 per month for one line with unlimited data, talk and text. But what if you could pay only $25 per month? Metro offers just that with their BYOD or bring your own phone plan. All you have to do is bring the phone you want to add the service to and pay $25 per month. You get unlimited 5G on one line with no contracts or credit checks.

This is going to be the foundation of your portfolio and it's up 83% in the past five years. Second, I'm adding another $3,000 into QQQ. That's the ETF that gives you exposure to the software and tech companies. And in the past five years, it's up 135%. Third, I'm going to add $2,000 into a high yield savings account. And that way I always have some cash on hand in case there are any opportunities to buy up any dips. Let me know if you have any questions. I'll also have some free downloads in my profile.

Created on 2025-01-20 21:42:03+00:00) If investments were guys, ETFs would be the stable dudes that are always there for you, they're going to take you to the airport, they call you when they say they're going to call you, and they're always working on self-development, in fact they're growing at 8% per year, but they can be a little boring sometimes. Bitcoin is the guy that microdoses LSD for breakfast, he lives in an apartment that looks like this, and one day he's spending 5k at the club, but then the next day he's asking you for money. He talks about changing the system, but he can't even commit to dinner plans. Financial stocks are like artists full of potential, one year they can be flying you around the world because they're mega successful, but then society kind of weighs a little bit heavier on them, they're a little bit sensitive, so when people start to talk bad about them, they go into a dark, deep depression, and their stock price falls because of it too. Gold is the old money guy and talks about legacy, he's reliable in tough times, goes skiing in Aspen, and he's going to be happy when everyone else is miserable. And it's especially true when times are tough in the world.

Created on 2020-02-23 09:02:10+00:00) The scale of a billion dollars is really crazy. So let's say one grain of rice is equivalent to 100 K and 10 grains of rice would be then a million.

I Just bought you like a Lamborghini right here, and I didn't even notice it was gone Here's a five million dollar house in California and oh look I still have all this money If you guys like that content, please follow me.

finfluencer_identification_user_prompt = """You will be presented with a series of questions related to a user of a Tiktok profile.
Each question is preceded by predefined responses with symbols (e.g. "A1", "A2" or "B1" etc.).
Please select, for each question, the most likely response based strictly on the provided profile data.

In your answer present, for each question, the selected symbol.
Write out in full the response associated with the selected symbol.
The chosen symbol / category must be the most likely to accurately represent this user.
You must only select one symbol / category per question.
A title, symbol and category cannot appear more than once in your answer.

For each selected symbol / category, please note the level of Speculation involved in this selection.
Present the Speculation level for each selection on a scale from 0 (not speculative at all, every single element of the user data was useful in the selection) to 100 (fully speculative, there is no information related to this title in the user data).
Speculation levels should be a direct measure of the amount of useful information available in the user's profile.
Speculation levels pertain only to the information available in the user data -- namely the username, name, description, location, profile picture and videos from this user -- and should not be affected by additional information available to you from any other source.
To ensure consistency, use the following guidelines to determine speculation levels:

0-20 (Low speculation): The user data provides clear and direct information relevant to the title. (e.g., explicit mention in the profile or videos)
21-40 (Moderate-low speculation): The user data provides indirect but strong indicators relevant to the title. (e.g., context from multiple sources within the profile or videos)
41-60 (Moderate speculation): The user data provides some hints or partial information relevant to the title. (e.g., inferred from user interests or indirect references)
61-80 (Moderate-high speculation): The user data provides limited and weak indicators relevant to the title. (e.g., very subtle hints or minimal context)
81-100 (High speculation): The user data provides no or almost no information relevant to the title. (e.g., assumptions based on very general information)

For each selected category, please explain at length what features of the data contributed to your choice and your speculation level.

Preserve a strictly structured answer to ease parsing of the text.
Format your output as follows for a categorical question (this is just an example, I do not care about this specific title or symbol / category):
**question: What is the age of the user in this profile?**
**explanation: [Detailed reasoning for selection]**
**symbol: A1)**
**category: 18-25**
**speculation: 90**

Format your output as follows for a numerical question with a scale of 0 to 100 (this is just an example, I do not care about this specific title or symbol / category):
