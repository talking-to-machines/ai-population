# Tiktok Market Signals Prompts
tiktok_finfluencer_onboarding_system_prompt = """You are analyzing a social media profile on TikTok to identify individuals who may be financial influencers (finfluencer).

DEFINITION OF A FINFLUENCER
A finfluencer is a creator whose content analyses the financial markets and goes on to give opinions, predictions, or recommendations about:
• Individual equities/stocks (e.g., stock market, S&P 500, tickers, options, day-trading setups, etc.)
• Crypto-assets (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, alt-coins)
• Foreign-exchange (e.g., FX / forex currency pairs)
• The macro economy and U.S. financial system (e.g., Federal Reserve policy, interest-rate outlook, inflation prints, jobs data, earnings season, market-moving news).

HALLMARK SIGNALS OF A FINFLUENCER
• Typically say or imply “buy/sell/hold” or “don’t miss this trade,” share price targets, or promote trading platforms, newsletters, paid courses, copy-trade services, affiliate links, etc.
• Frequent use of market-specific terms: “stock picks,” “entry level,” “S&P 500,” “BTC,” “NFP report,” “ticker-symbol ____,” “options flow,” “FX pair,” “rate-cut,” “Federal Reserve,” etc.  
• Explicit or implicit recommendations/predictions: “I’m buying,” “price target $150,” “this coin will 10×,” “short before earnings,” “don’t miss this swing.”  
• Promotional or affiliate language: coupon codes for brokerages, screenshots of profits, “link in bio to copy my trades,” paid Discord, Patreon, master-class.  
• Urgency or emotional triggers: “last chance,” “100 % ROI,” “financial freedom,” “passive income NOW.”  
• Visual cues of wealth purportedly earned from markets (luxury cars, profit dashboards, bold green/red P&L screenshots).

DEFINITION OF A NON-FINFLUENCER
A non-finfluencer is any profile that:
• Discusses topics completely unrelated to finance and the economy
• Focuses on personal-finance hygiene (budgeting, saving, couponing, credit-score repair, basic money habits) without market picks
• Teaches mechanics of trading (“how to place a limit order,” “what is leverage”) but stops short of issuing actionable calls or price views.

HALLMARK SIGNS OF A NON-FINFLUENCER
• Content limited to household budgeting, debt payoff tips, generic ‘save money’ hacks, student-loan talk, couponing, side-hustles.  
• Purely academic or definitional explainers without advice (“what is a candlestick,” “history of Bitcoin,” “how the Fed works”).  
• “Not financial advice” disclaimers with no actual recommendation content.  
• Focus on trading psychology, motivation, or platform tutorials **only**, with no picks or directional calls.

Below are three Tiktok profiles and their most recent posts that exemplify a financial influencer:

Video Transcript: Things are not looking good for Target based on real-time data I have access to. They had a pretty bad earnings miss last week. They blamed the boycotts and you can see here that it hasn't stopped. In fact, it looks like sales are starting to really drop off a cliff. C-score is minus 78, meaning we are quite bearish on the stock based on this data. I dug into it a bit more because that spike down is pretty massive and it looks like there's three other things happening that's not helping the company. First is Dollar General is taking market share. A lot of consumers wanting to stretch their dollar even more. Second is Amazon, specifically Amazon same-day delivery. It's very convenient. It's eating, starting to really eat into Target's lunch. And lastly, TikTok Shop. Instead of going to Target to browse, consumers are doing it now through their phone on TikTok Shop specifically for products like candles, mugs, beauty, room decor, dupes of Stanley Cups, not the hockey, but the actual cups, beauty gadgets, budget kitchenware. These are all categories that Target used to dominate in store. TikTok Shop is really starting to eat their lunch. It sounds like there's a money-making opportunity here. So sell Target shares, buy Dollar General, buy Amazon, and if you run a business, find a way to start promoting it on TikTok Shop.

Video Description: Is XRP like Aluminum? Everyone talks about Bitcoin as digital gold — but what about the rest of the crypto ecosystem? In this video, I break down how each major token maps to the metals and materials that built the modern world: 	•	XRP = Aluminum 	•	Ethereum = Copper 	•	Solana = Titanium 	•	Polygon = Steel 	•	Chainlink = Fiber Optics 	•	Filecoin = Concrete 	•	Arbitrum = Rebar This isn’t financial advice — it’s a new lens to understand what crypto is actually for.

Video Transcript: XRP is a new hot crypto token. Why do we need so many tokens? If you're a skeptic, this analogy helps me see things a lot more clearly, including how big of an opportunity crypto really is. First, I want you to picture all the major crypto tokens as if they were metals. Bitcoin is gold, a precious metal. XRP is aluminum, a base metal. It's not flashy. It's not rare. But just like aluminum, it helps move things around very quickly. Money settles within three to five seconds. So it's kind of like Swift, you know, for wiring money. Then you might be asking yourself, as I did, well, like, why would you want to hold wire money through something that moves up and down? XRP settles money so fast that your exposure is very, very, very limited to the actual underlying token. Then think of Ethereum kind of like copper. It powers the whole crypto economy. It is everywhere, just like copper. Copper's in your walls, in your phone, your car. It's the essential infrastructure layer or metal that makes everything run. Then we have Solana, which is kind of like titanium. It's just lighter, more meant for consumer applications. Like when you golf, you don't want a heavy golf club. You want titanium. You don't want a heavy metal. So if you think about the crypto industry more on the use cases, things make a lot more sense instead of all these like coins going up and down. As a former skeptic, I then asked myself, OK, but like, why do you need these coins then like moving up and down? Remember that gold, copper, aluminum, the metals industry all have markets, too, where you can bet on them going up or down in price. There's some other tokens that are worth mentioning that also provide a lot of utility. I just rolled out a bit more of a detailed post on this on my Substack for free, where you can learn a bit more on all of these tokens and what they can do.

Video Transcript: Tomorrow's a very important day for the markets. NVIDIA is reporting they are 6% of the S&P 500. Options makers have priced in a 7% move in either direction. The cost to run AI models has also come down significantly, 80% over the last two years. What does this all mean? How's the stock gonna do? Here are my two cents. First, let's look at the chart. This is the daily on the stock, and you'll see that it is consolidating. Usually when you see this type of triangle, it means the stock will either jump up or down once it reaches its apex. If you look at momentum indicators, you'll see that both MACD and RSI are showing that the stock is currently overbought. However, for this earnings, I think we actually should be looking at the weekly because it does tell a bit of a more medium to longer term trend, and you'll see it's telling a very different story. Since a lot of the news has come out recently on the company doing a lot of work internationally, you'll see it has reversed from bearish to bullish. A lot of it's gonna come down to guidance, and if you put yourself in the shoes of the CEO Jensen, I think there's incentive to provide very strong guidance, positive guidance, even though there are risks on the geopolitical front, and I would wanna do it to keep the momentum going. You know, a lot of top news and headlines have come out on the company doing a lot of work internationally. Doing so would also scare away competitors, strengthen leverage with suppliers, and it would really give big tech companies really an incentive to keep spending. Here's a free playbook on their earnings I just published on Substack, where I also talk about the impacts of lower compute and inference costs on NVIDIA long.

Video Transcript: Why is the stock market up when the bond market is flashing warning signs? Market prices in the worst case scenario. But remember that equities and the stock market cares more about the future. So you can see here in 2011, when the US was first downgraded, a big spike down, but within six months, the stock market recovered. In 2023, October, Congress faced another shutdown over the debt ceiling. This rattled the markets. You can see this big sell off here. But then this very quickly recovered and the market hit all time highs. After that, 2018, Trump tax cuts, big sell off in the market, bond yields spiked. It was called a volmageddon even, but you can see here within months, the market also recovered. And lastly, 2021, the American Rescue Plan, Biden pushed this out in March. Markets sold off, bond yields spiked, but then the markets continued to soar after that. This time, things are different. Take a look at the debt to GDP ratio today versus all those other years. How do you profit from this and how can the US get out of this AI and crypto? So first, how do you reduce debt to GDP? You can increase GDP through improving productivity by leveraging AI. Second, how do you get out of the current debt situation? Well, you could hold crypto in your reserves, make money through the appreciation. There's a reason why Bitcoin is at all time highs today. If you can do that, then you can stomach those large interest rate payments. But do you think I'm crazy to think this or does this make sense? We'd love to hear your thoughts in the comments.

Video Transcript: We went from the fastest stock market decline to the fastest recovery ever. What do we do next? Here are some thoughts. What you're gonna do is gonna depend on your risk tolerance. Are you a high or a low? Also, your time in market, short or long? If you're in the top left quadrant, it means you're a risk taker and you're relatively new to the market. I'm also going to assume that you're far away from retirement. The strategy here would be to buy the dip. Every time you see red, sprinkle money into the market. If you're in the top right quadrant, meaning you're a high risk taker and you've been in the market for quite some time, you really don't have to do much. I think that is the best thing to do right now because the market has bounced back. If you really wanna do something because you're that high risk taker, you may wanna have more exposure to tech and growth, in particular, AI stocks, quantum computing, stocks of the future. If you're in the bottom left quadrant, you're new to the markets, but your risk tolerance is low. There are a few strategies you can deploy. Because your time horizon is still very long, I would still consider buying the dip. You could consider adding stop losses. You can consider buying put options. You can consider shorting stocks if you really want to. You can consider selling call options. These are some of the strategies you would wanna look into, but because your time horizon is long, I would still consider buying the dip. Lastly, if you're on the bottom right, meaning your tolerance for risk is low, but you've been in the market for quite some time, normally the answer is bonds. Shift your money into bonds. But bond prices are coming down because yields are going up. So my recommendation would be to de-risk. Sell some of your stocks and some of your higher risk assets and just park your money into a high yield savings account. Are there any strategies I'm missing? Please leave a comment. I'm also doing a live tomorrow morning. Link is in my bio.

Video Transcript: Stock market futures are down, and there's a lot of negativity around the Moody's U.S. downgrade. I think people are overreacting a bit here, and here's why. First, Moody's was just very, very slow here, because the S&P downgraded the U.S. already in 2011, and then Fitch downgraded the U.S. in 2023. I posted a video last week saying we could be in a new bull market. You can check out the video in the playlist here below, and my conviction in that continues to build. The biggest drivers are, one, global liquidity. There's over $8 trillion sitting on the sidelines, ready to plow into the stock market. Two, savings. Savings rates in the U.S. continues to go up. I think that'll be a really good buffer in case of any tariff price shocks. Three is strong corporate earnings. Company earnings have been a lot stronger than expected, and this is largely due to companies having spent the last few years preparing for this moment through making it through a global pandemic, high interest rate environment. Lastly, AI. In the first quarter alone, there was a 71% jump in spending on AI infrastructure.

Video Transcript: We might be at the start of a new bull market. Here's why and the mindset shift you're going to have to make fast to profit from this. The US-China trade truce was the final data point the market needed to be able to start looking into the future and entering into this new mode. It's the same mode the market was in in 2020. If you guys remember, the stock market tanked and more and more bad news just kept coming out. But the market knew, hey, the Fed's going to backstop, rates are going to be cut to near zero. There's going to be a lot of liquidity in the market, and that's going to drive consumer spending, businesses, and the market. And the market is in a very similar setup right now. So one data point is the yield on the 10-year Treasury is high, but tech stocks, gross stocks are up. Usually when you see this, it's the market saying, look, we know there's probably going to be some risk of inflation, probably less so risk of recession now, but there will be some inflation. But growth is going to offset that. And the market is telling us that it's going to be tech, it's going to be AI. And so what I would be embracing right now, if I was, I mean, I'm doing it, is imagine you're now in the future in 2026. Tariffs are behind us. We have potential tax cuts, deregulation, all really, really good things for the global economy and stocks. And the market is going to start to price that in. The sectors that should outperform in this next wave are here. The big one is AI, because AI is deflationary. It's going to help bring down costs, and a lot of those costs are going to be passed on to the consumer.

Video Transcript: Is the recession canceled? That is the question of the day. You'll see that a ton of Wall Street analysts have cut the odds of one happening and even increasing price targets for the stock market. On Calshi, 38% chance of one happening, down from 70. Here's why this is happening so fast, and it has to do with the stock market and consumer confidence. That's where it starts. A higher stock market leads to more consumer confidence and business confidence. On the consumer side, with lower inflation now expected and a higher stock market, consumers will likely spend more and no longer delay the purchase of big ticket items, like potentially a house. And so with more consumer spending and lower inflation, businesses will also benefit. They will expect lower input prices because of lower potential inflation, which will increase their margins in which they can use that money to hire more, which will lead to more profits. And more profits leads to higher earnings per share and stock prices are derived by earnings per share. And with higher stock market, consumers will then also feel better and it is a bit of a vicious cycle. On top of all of this is AI. I feel like AI is going to play a very big role in decreasing inflation because AI will reduce the cost of producing goods and services. AI should make companies, people, governments more productive. And I do think the stock market is starting to price that in. Certain stocks, ETFs and assets will outperform others in a very big way during periods like these. I'll be speaking to that tomorrow morning on a TikTok live. The link is in my bio. But back on the trading floor days, we call this risk on mode and it definitely does feel like that right now.

Video Transcript: Want to share some real talk on investing and on the markets. I feel like there are a lot of people who may have made a lot of money during the recent market rally, feeling really good. And there's also a bunch of people who are FOMOing because they missed out. There is a lot of noise, especially here on TikTok and want to share my two cents and the most unbiased view possible. Number one is please do your own research. Even if the video doesn't have that laid out, build that into your head that no matter what, if anyone tells you how to invest your money, step number one should be to do your own research immediately before you act on it, if you act on it. Number two is context matters. If you see a video about a stock, about someone's view on the market, about an ETF, first ask yourself, are they incentivized to be talking about this right now? Are they being sponsored? Are they, is there a conflict of interest? And the quickest way to figure that out is go on their profile and click through a few videos. Context matters also means that if someone is super bullish right now, it doesn't mean that they've always been super bullish. Maybe they were bearish before. Do some research on the actual person speaking to you, especially if you are going to put real money at risk to follow their recommendations. Number three, there are comments on, oh, you shouldn't listen to people on TikTok about investing, that's the wrong thing to do. I disagree. There are some really smart people on TikTok who are here to provide knowledge and value, and they are putting themselves out there to do that. I think the advice should really be, make sure to get as many perspectives as possible. Don't listen to only one person, but there are some very smart people here providing value. However, it ties all back to do your own research. Make sure that if you are going to listen to someone about investing, and if you are putting real money at risk, who are they? Are they experienced, or are they just here to try to get your attention and are they incentivized to do things that maybe aren't aligned with your own portfolio, money, or self-interest? If anyone here, whether you're a consumer of content or a content creator, has any additional thoughts on this that would help everyone, please do so, because I think, leave a comment, because I think this is a very important time given what's happening in the stock market right now.

Video Transcript: So the market is up big today and I want to post a video because I've been getting a lot of comments like these and if you haven't been following all of my videos and just randomly saw one, I can see how what I've been saying, especially more recently, can be a bit misleading. I did want to clarify. So one, if you watched the first video that is pinned on my profile, I have been encouraging people to sprinkle money into the market as the market dipped. So as early as April 3rd, I've been saying, and especially if you've been enjoying my TikTok lives, sprinkle money into the market. Dollar cost average. Don't wait for the very bottom. It is very hard to time. And I have been saying that since April 3rd, check out the first video of my profile. And then on April 6th, I mentioned that based on how much the market has fallen in the short period of time, we normally looking back history would see a 10% double digit pop and that is exactly what happened. And then since April 6th, if you watch my videos, it's been kind of mixed. There are certain days when I say that what is happening is bearish. And then there are certain days I am saying that the market could keep pumping. And this is because things have been changing on a daily basis. And some of the smartest Wall Street analysts have had a hard time forecasting what is happening here. So unless you've been able to read the mind of the president or have an inside scoop, it is essentially been a toss up. What I've been saying, though, over the last week, and if you go on CNBC, there are a lot of analysts who agree is that terrorists have not been in market yet. So this big pump right now is largely driven by retail money. It's largely driven by greed. And if you look at what happened in 2018, when terrorists finally came into effect, and when the impacts of it started to become clear, that is when the market ultimately sold off. Did I see today coming? No. And I don't think most people did. Unless again, you had some sort of inside scoop. Do I think it's too early to call it a win? You know, some people like, oh, the market is just going to keep pumping. You were wrong. Look, I don't care about being right or wrong. I care about protecting profits. And there's still a lot of unknowns. So as someone who's been in the market for 17 years, three downturns, I think it's still way too early to call this a win. Like, oh, we're back to bull market. You know, everything is over. Way too early, especially when some of the smartest investors, including Warren Buffett, are sitting in mainly cash still.

Video Transcript: Here's how you can profit from the wild rotation that's happening because of today's U.S. China news. The U.S. dollar has fallen substantially since beginning of the year. You can see here it is now starting to rebound as more confidence and stability builds back on the U.S. economy. A stronger U.S. dollar is not going to help gold. As you can see, the markets are up while gold is down. In the near term, we should also see oil prices rebound a bit here. This news should also help semiconductor and AI stocks. The blue line being SMH, a semiconductor ETF. The red line being the S&P 500. As you can see here, the SMH ETF is now significantly outperforming the S&P. There will be a lot more capital coming back to the U.S. now. You can see here that the red line above is the S&P. The blue line is the European ETF IEV. For some time, the blue has been outperforming the red. But look, as of today, the S&P is now beating the European ETF again. And the same goes for Japan. For quite some time, the red line again being the S&P 500. The blue line being the Japanese ETF EWJ. It is now back to par. In the near term, we're also likely going to see a rotation back into risk-on categories and sectors. As you can see, this is as of today. Consumer staples and utilities are selling off while consumer discretionary, IT, tech, risk-on categories are outperforming. A list of all the stocks I'll be buying and selling can be found on my sub stack. The link is in my bio. Here's a summary of everything I just said and a list of ETFs, sectors, and assets you may want to get in and out of given this news.

Video Transcript: Stock market's behaving a lot like 2008, which means we're gonna have a massive correction soon. Wait, actually, nevermind. It's behaving a lot like 2011 and 2012. Wait, nevermind, it's behaving a lot like the late 90s. There are so many of these comparison charts I'm seeing right now. The fact that there are so many different years that people are comparing the current situation to means people have no idea what's gonna happen next. Here's what we do know, though. We can learn from the past. I think we're closer to a combination between 2018, 2022, and late 90s. So in 2018, market was on a tear until the tariffs actually got implemented and were in market. That is when the stock market actually sold off. In 2022, an inflation scare. The Fed used the same words. Inflation is transitory. Look what happened. Once inflation started to show, it spooked the market and the market sold off. In the late 90s, we had the internet. It was the dot-com era. Right now, we have the AI era. And what I don't think the market is yet seeing is the potential deflationary impacts of AI. If AI, and it's moving super fast right now, if it can truly help companies reduce costs, drive revenue, that's deflationary. If AI can help reduce costs, those costs should be passed off to the consumer. The prices of products and services globally would come down. Workforces become more efficient. Companies become more profitable. So there could be a world whereby the stock market could potentially keep pumping like it did in the late 90s based on AI. And where it's different this time around is there are only 30 million people on the internet back in the late 90s. There are a lot more than 30 million people using AI right now. Love to hear your thoughts. Are these the years we're closest compared to? Are there different years I'm missing? Please leave a comment.

Video Transcript: The stock market rally is losing steam fast. I would definitely consider taking some chips off the table today. We're back to pre-liberation day levels, which is wild. The market's about to hit not just one major wall of resistance, but two. How do average people take profits or take chips off the table? You just have to sell some stock. You don't have to sell everything. But as someone who has been in the market now for over 17 years, seen three downturns, I have never regretted taking some chips off the table in a moment like this. Here's another way to think about it. And I'll continue with this poker analogy. So all these Wall Street analysts have decreased their targets for the S&P 500. The S&P 500 right now is at $56.57. The average of all these analysts' price target, the average is $58.08. That's only 2.7% increase from here. So the analogy would be like, it's like going all in when the pot is very small. Is it worth it to make an additional, call it 2.7%, to potentially lose a lot more of that because tariffs have not even started being in market yet?

Video Transcript: Why is the stock market still going up? Didn't the Fed say yesterday that there's increased risk of recession and more inflation coming? Stock market's in full green mode. Here's what's happening and it doesn't usually end well. There's an old saying on Wall Street, buy the rumor, sell the news. And that's exactly what's happening right now. Markets start to price in the anticipation of an event. When the event actually then happens, markets usually would then sell off. So think about, for example, when, I don't know, Tesla was added to the S&P 500. I remember very clearly because I was trading Tesla back then, this was a few years ago. And people would just, and a lot of it is retail traders, buy Tesla, buy Tesla, buy Tesla. If you think about it, nothing fundamentally has changed about the company. But a lot of this buying is greed and it is a lot of retail investors. The difference between this Tesla example and what is happening with tariffs right now is that tariffs actually will have a substantial impact on the economy. So the market had a big sell off a few weeks ago because it was very unexpected what happened. And now as these new trade deals get negotiated, oh, it's better, oh, it's better. And so the market may keep going up, driven by a lot of greed. Once these tariffs get enacted, once real hard data comes out on the impacts, that is when I think the market's going to really sell off.

Video Transcript: prices are tanking, isn't that a good thing? No, it's not. It usually signals a recession when that happens, and that's not even the scariest part. So how does this all happen? So firstly, oil prices are tanking because OPEC decided to increase supply. And when that happens, and there's not a lot of demand, prices fall. Prices have to fall because you're not at the equilibrium point. You know, econ 101, supply and demand. And why is there not a lot of demand for oil? Well, there could be many reasons. Slowdown in economic activity, slowdown in shipping, manufacturing, just general slowdown in economic activity. And so during recessions and global slowdowns, oil does fall, and that's why it has spooked the market. And when I said this is not the scariest part, what do I mean? If this continues, this will create another problem for the Fed to fight. We've got inflation, we've got stagflation, and then there's now a potential risk of deflation. Deflation happens when consumers delay, consumers and businesses, delay purchases of goods and services because they expect prices to be lower. And because they expect oil prices to be lower and therefore things get cheaper. That usually is not the case. But as a result, businesses may have to lower their prices and it becomes a bit self-fulfilling. Consumer demand softens, businesses have to lower prices, and therefore corporate profits fall. And another problem for the Fed to fight. And that is why when the Fed spoke today, Jerome Powell has been very careful with his words. Because consumers have already started panic buying ahead of tariffs, pulling up their spending. Spend, spend, spend, spend, spend. If the Fed came out and said the economy is slowing, consumers may delay their spending because they may expect prices to decrease. And if that happens, that'll make things even worse. And that'll drive inflation to come down even faster, making the situation that we're currently in even tougher to get out of. I'm really trying not to be doom and gloom. I'm just trying to relay the bigger picture of what is happening here, why I think it's going to be very important to be patient, why we've only seen the tip of the iceberg, and why this could be a really good time to park money in safe haven assets like Bitcoin, gold, and even international markets. You know, the U.S. is not the only stock market you can invest in. I'll be putting up some more content on other stock ideas from other countries, Europe, China, etc. But please be patient and be careful out there.

Video Transcript: You could be leaving a lot of money on the table if you're only buying stocks. You know you can short stocks as well, essentially betting on stocks or the market going down. Especially in this market, there's a lot of money that you could be making. I came out, for example, out of 2020 flat when the market was at the bottom because I was short. It is not easy. It is risky. But if you want to learn how to do it, I'm doing a TikTok live for free this afternoon at 5pm. The market's losing momentum. This could be a really good time to short. Not knowing how to short stocks is like playing chess only on offense. Or it's like driving a car without knowing how to reverse. It's a very important part of one's toolkit, especially if you want to be a good investor or trader. I'll be going through what stocks to short, how to short, the risks involved, and how to make a lot of money. I think now's the time. I'll see you at 5pm.

Video Transcript: The stock market's about to hit a wall based on real-time consumer spending data. It's the same data that Wall Street's top hedge funds use, the same data we use to predict the first market drop. It's showing that consumer spending fell across all major categories. This will start to get priced in this week. A lot of funds will start selling. Here's what it is showing. Visa is widely viewed on Wall Street as a good barometer of how the economy is doing. You'll see here that since beginning of the year, spending on Visa cards has gone up, but it has hit a bit of a plateau as of recently and looks like it's spiking back down. To verify what I was seeing, I want to look at MasterCard as well to make sure it wasn't just a Visa thing. Same thing. It has plateaued and on its way down. I had my data science team dig in and it is very interesting what we're seeing. So up here is overall spend across debit cards, credit cards. So it's Visa, MasterCard, Amex, and Discover. You'll notice the spike up in spend in March. It is now public knowledge that this is consumers pulling up their spending. So in advance of tariffs, a lot of spending happening. It is very important to note that furniture, fixtures, and appliances has been pulling everything up. So yes, in the month of March, as you can see here, consumer spending across all the major categories saw a pretty big lift. But look at April. It is reversed in a pretty big way. The only category that is seeing a lift is still furniture, fixtures, and appliances. These are expensive, durable goods that consumers are buying because they are concerned that it'll spike up even more in price. It looks like the selling has already started based on stock market features. I'll be doing a TikTok live in the morning Eastern to go through all of this, what it means, what I'm going to be buying, what I'm going to be selling. It's going to be a very big week in the markets. If you've been waiting to buy into this market, this is going to be your chance.

Video Transcript: There's a massive rotation happening out of gold in a Bitcoin right now. It's causing a lot of confusion in the markets. I just got some Intel and it could be China. Chinese are off on holiday. That explains why gold is down $100. They're also selling and have been selling for some time. I took a look at some charts and it is not just them. There's a reason why everyone is selling gold right now. All right, guys, this is going to blow your mind. So orange is gold. Blue down here is the US dollar index. I drew a line. As you can see, there's a very clear line of support. Every time the US dollar index bounces or hits the line, look what happens. Gold tanks. This happened in 2012, 2014, 2020, and right now, 2025. What happens when the US dollar goes up? Gold comes down because it is now more expensive to buy gold because it is typically denominated in US dollars. You can see here over the last few months, Bitcoin has been coming down. Gold has been going up. But as of today, Bitcoin is now on its way up and gold is coming down. Institutions are back and they are buying Bitcoin like crazy. Since April 22nd, BlackRock's ETF has amassed over $4.5 billion in inflows. Institutional buying has surged. Bitcoin is seen 40% undervalued. And a lot of this is because a lot of governments and central banks are starting to hold Bitcoin. If you know someone who recently bought Bitcoin or should be buying Bitcoin, tag them in the comments.

Video Transcript: Everyone is freaking out on the GDP number that just came out thinking a recession is imminent. There's an indicator that could actually help get the US out of recession and where it closes today is going to be very important. This indicator is a yield on the 10-year treasury. It is at a critical level today. If it breaks it and keeps falling, there could be a world where tariffs get reversed and the Fed next week could even be in a position to start bringing rates down because it is very clear that the economy is slowing. So here's why today is critical. You'll see that since September, the Trump pump brought yields up. That's because people sold treasuries, pumped into the stock market. Since then, it tried to come down. And then on this day was when Trump made the announcement that paused tariffs. That should have brought yields down, but it actually spiked it back up. You'll see though that it has since come back down and we are at this key technical level, this black line. If it breaks it, it is likely to keep falling. And you'll see if you look at MACD on momentum and RSI, both momentum indicators, they are both saying that the yield on a 10-year treasury actually should keep falling. Here's how it would all play out, but it would have to happen very quickly. So if yields continue to fall, there's just less need for tariffs because you're solving for a budget deficit. And you do so by either bringing in more revenue or decreasing your costs. And given the magnitude of the interest payments the U.S. has to make, every 0.5 percent drop in yields is massive. And so if that happens, then there's less need to tariff countries because tariffs are actually terrible, but it feels like it was needed to get revenue very quickly. It is short-term revenue for a country, but medium to long-term, it's terrible because countries won't want to work with you and your overall revenue comes down. Also, what would happen is less inflation because of less tariffs. Jerome Powell next week could be in a position, again, if this all happens, to potentially consider decreasing rates, cutting rates, because the only reason why he's not doing that right now is because of the inflationary impact of tariffs. And if he were to do that and signal more rate cuts ahead, the yield would fall even more so, making the interest payments even less. I've just been sitting here thinking about this, I'm like, am I crazy? Would love to get your comments and thoughts on this. And am I missing something?

Video Transcript: US and China need to figure things out soon. Some are saying that it's gonna be very hard to reverse. We are starting to see the damage. Port volumes in LA are starting to plummet. Here's what I think could happen next. The most immediate and direct impact is gonna be chaos in the world of retail. A lot of companies loaded up on products and inventory over the last few weeks in anticipation of these tariffs. We haven't seen much impact on prices yet. And the key is yet. Because many of these companies, it was business as usual. Analysts are saying that in the next five to seven weeks, a lot of the inventories that companies have bought will be depleted. What will that mean? It'll mean that we'll likely see more of this, emptier shelves. A secondary impacts that will be even more harmful, which is increased prices. It's also gonna be very hard for retailers to forecast, which may eat into corporate profits, especially for big retailers like Walmart, Target, and even Amazon. We're also likely gonna see economic slowdown, especially at key ports. Key ports being Los Angeles, Long Beach, Tacoma, Oakland, and Seattle. 60%, 6-0% of their imports are tied to China. As imports collapse, this will have trickle-down effects. Not only are the dock workers, warehouse workers, truck drivers impacted, it will flow into the local economy. First, this may seem like a small localized thing, but when you add it all up, that is where this could have pretty major impacts on the full economy. First two impacts are more recessionary. Supply chain disruptions is gonna be more inflationary. It's just gonna be more expensive for companies to source goods elsewhere. And those costs are likely gonna be passed onto the consumer. Hopefully this drives some urgency for both sides to figure things out. Until then, I continue to encourage people to hold assets like gold and Bitcoin that usually do well in times of uncertainty like.

Video Transcript: Here's a trending AI stock I want to tell you guys about. The company is called Thumbs Up Media, ticker TZUP on the NASDAQ. The company IPO'd only a few months ago. The current market cap is under 50 million, making it a small cap play with a ton of potential upside. $148 billion. This is the total amount of money spent on display ads in the US. Also the market that Thumbs Up Media is looking to disrupt. The advertising industry is still pretty archaic. Yes, it has gone through a ton of transformation, but the way that businesses reach consumers today is pretty outdated. And it's done through ads. It's done through clicks and eyeballs and in a very static way. Thumbs Up Media is looking to change all of that by deploying AI agents to promote products, brands, and services in a lot more of a personalized one-to-one way. The company is growing a ton and building a lot of very interesting technologies. As you guys know, I only talk about and promote companies I believe in, and this is one of them. The big why now, right now, for a company like Thumbs Up Media is that marketing has become very expensive. It is very costly for a business to reach you and I. And I do believe that this space is going through a lot of transformation right now. The future of the advertising industry is gonna be a lot more personalized and one-to-one because at the end of the day, who likes ads? So using AI to make marketing a lot more cost-effective is gonna be very top of mind for marketers, especially during an economic climate like today. This video is in partnership with Digitallandia on behalf of Thumbs Up. This reminds me a lot like the early days of social media. So there are a lot of opportunities ahead and Thumbs Up is right in the middle of it.

Video Transcript: Which stocks should we buy in a recession? Here are eight stocks I'm personally rotating into in my million dollar portfolio in case the economy slows. As I mentioned in the prior video in this playlist, half my portfolio are going to be low risk stocks focused on protecting capital. And the latter half of the portfolio are going to be more growth oriented stocks that should still do well in a slowdown type of environment. The low risk side of the barbell portfolio, the first name is Costco. Consumers will be buying in more bulk as the economy potentially slows. Second company is Marathon Petroleum. If you have a car, you're going to need gas. Spending data we have access to is showing pretty good growth on the name as well. Maybe more consumers are doing staycations right now and driving instead of flying. Number three is Walmart. It's a name that typically does well during slowdowns and a name that a lot of folks, including large institutions, rotate into. Number four is Coca-Cola. You know, it's a name everyone knows, strong balance sheet, and it's a consumer staple. On the high risk side, these are all growth stocks with AI exposure. I think corporations are going to continue to invest in AI heavily, even in a slowdown type of environment. Four stocks here are Nvidia, Broadcom, who had very strong earnings today. Marvel Technologies, a name that's recently been beaten up, so it could be a good entry point right now. The last one is Tesla. I know it's a bit controversial, but in a slowdown type of environment, consumers may trade down to EV because it is cheaper. I'm starting to build up my positions in this portfolio, so follow along if you want tips and tricks on how to properly enter and exit into stocks.

Video Transcript: Which stocks should we buy in a recession? I'm going to show you guys how to put together a portfolio, the way the pros do it, to both protect and grow your capital during these volatile times. This is called a barbell portfolio strategy, where you're buying stocks that are both very low risk and stocks that are higher risk. So you're excluding everything that is medium risk. The low risk end of the barbell strategy is going to include consumer staples, utilities, and healthcare. The high risk part of the portfolio is going to focus on AI, a category that I believe should continue to do well even during tough economic times. If you're more conservative, here's what your portfolio could look like down here below. And if you want to take on a bit more risk, here is what your portfolio could look like instead. I think this portfolio has a really good shot of being in the market, and I'll be sharing the individual stock names tomorrow.

Video Transcript: I'm gonna buy 10 shares of Tesla today. They're gonna kill it this year. Really? Then I'll do the same too. Let's hold it for at least a year. Deal. 12 months later. Oh, hey, old friends. Did you keep your Tesla shares? They're up a lot. Oh, I actually sold them last month. I made $3,000, but I paid $1,000 in taxes. So 2K total profit. Yikes, paper hands. So you paid a 33% tax rate on your profit? Is that bad? Yeah, your tax rate becomes much lower if you hold them for longer than a year, only 15%. I had no idea. I wish I didn't sell it in the 11th month. That's all right. Now you know, and that's why you should follow this account.

Video Transcript: Here are three financial milestones that tell me you're on the right track, and this is if you're making $100,000 or more per year. Number one is to avoid lifestyle inflation. So every time you get a raise, you're gonna start having more disposable income, and when most people get paid more, they will spend it. I'm all for doing that to a certain extent, but just because you can afford something now, like a nicer car or a bigger house, doesn't mean that you need to do so. Living under your means is one of the best ways to not only accumulate wealth, but also have peace of mind when it comes to money. Milestone number two is to know your financial independence number. You can retire early if you make a good income and have a good savings rate, and you should know what that number needed to do that is. Here's a great resource from networthify.com where you can plug in your income and your savings rate, and then it'll tell you how quickly you can retire. So if you have a portfolio of $250,000, you make $100,000 a year, and you're saving 20% of your income, you could actually retire in 19.5 years. And milestone number three is to increase your overall gains on investments. When you start making more money, you can start to take some risks with a small percentage of your portfolio. So for me, that would be about 5% of my portfolio. I personally have benefited from higher conviction stocks like Nvidia, Meta, and even Robinhood. And for some of my friends, it might be their real estate investments. Don't risk more than you can afford to lose, but it's a good way to build wealth long-term. I hope this helps. Let me know what you think in the comments.

Video Transcript: The US and China have agreed to a trade deal when it comes to tariffs, and here's what it means for you. So first, the deal means that reciprocal tariffs between both the countries go from 125% to 10%, that's really good news, but the US will still keep a 20% extra duty on fentanyl in place, meaning that the total tariffs on China stand at around 30%. The deal will be for 90 days as they continue to negotiate for a longer term plan, but it still should mean a few things. First is that goods imported from China to the US won't incur these crazy tariff rates, which hopefully means that these costs aren't going to be passed down to you. Second is that the risk of recession in 2025 has decreased to 39% according to Polymarket, but the long-term future is still uncertain. Number three is that quarter one GDP came in negative, which is usually a sign of a contracting economy, but that was largely due to the fact that there were so many imports coming in. Many companies were importing goods like crazy to front-run tariffs, and imports actually subtract from GDP, so we'll actually see if that changes for Q2. And number four, stocks should recover barring any catastrophic events and should continue to do fine for at least the next 90 days. Let me know if you have any questions in the comments.

Video Transcript: I made $600 buying and selling my gold bar from Costco and the New York Post actually calls this eye popping, but the money that I made from the videos, that's actually crazy, let me show you. On YouTube, I had 15 million views when I sold my gold bar and that got me about $1,900 and that's about 20 cents per thousand views, but TikTok was even crazier. On TikTok, it got 6.6 million views. Because that video was over a minute long, I was able to get it monetized and so that's 3.3 million qualified views. I don't know why half of the views are qualified, but still, that was $4,350. So in total, your favorite finance creator, me, hopefully, I made $6,250 on just selling the gold bar and making the videos, not too bad. What does that tell you? Make videos, they're pretty great.

Video Transcript: Here are three financial milestones that tell me you're on the right track, and this is for those earning around $75,000 per year. I made a previous video on these milestones to hit for those making around 40K per year, so make sure you watch that video and have those covered before you move on to this video. Milestone number one is to track and budget your money. That means you should know approximately how much you're spending on every single category in your finances. Once you figure that out, we wanna cut relentlessly around the things that do not fulfill us or drive us forward and start spending or saving money on the things that do. Milestone number two is to track your net worth, and just like dieting or going to the gym, if you start tracking what you're actually eating or lifting every day and what your weight is, you'll have this natural awareness that will help you out longer term, and the same will go for your money and finance goals. Here's a table of median net worth in America by age. Now, these numbers are, I think, in my opinion, a little low so you should try to aim for double these numbers. If you'd like a free net worth tracker, I will leave one in the caption or in my profile. And milestone number three is to figure out your target savings rate in order to retire. If you're starting at the age of 30 with $0 saved, in order to retire, you need 4.6% of your income saved every single year to hit a $750,000 balance by retirement. At age 40, that goes up to a savings rate of 10.67%, saving $8,000 per year, and then at age 50, that's a whopping 27.4%, saving $20,600 per year. Let me know if you have any questions in the comments.

Video Transcript: Hey guys, I'm in Vegas, and this is Casino Secrets. The first thing is that there are no windows or clocks in a casino so that you lose track of time. Swap machines actually make the most amount of money for casinos, and in Nevada, they're legally required to pay out a minimum of 85% of their bets as winnings. That means if you put $100 into one of these machines, over time you can expect to win about $85 in the long run. The carpets are ugly and disorienting, and that's done on purpose so that you look up at the games. Lastly, there are no hard right turns in a casino. Everything just kind of flows. Casino designers don't want you making hard right turns because that activates the decision making part of your brain, which they definitely don't want. What casino secrets do you know? Let me know in the comments.

Video Transcript: Here are three financial milestones that tell me you're on the right track if you're making around $40,000 per year. Number one is to have no consumer debt like credit card or buy now pay later debt. Since your take-home pay comes out to around $2,700 per month, after you account for the cost of rent and other bills, money could be pretty tight. By having this debt, you are compounding your problems and an extra $100 per month in interest payments could be the difference between having some savings for retirement versus not. All right, milestone number two is to fill up your emergency fund as well as maybe contribute to a Roth IRA. So aim for three months of an emergency fund first. So if your expenses are $2,700 per month, you multiply that by three and you need minimum $8,100 in your savings account. If you reach that point, you can start putting some of your paycheck into a Roth IRA and right now the contribution limit in a Roth IRA is $7,000 per year for individuals under the age of 50 and 8,000 per year for over 50. And milestone number three is that we should start looking for ways to make a little extra money so you don't have to go out and entirely get a new career or switch jobs. But if you can make some money on the side or build out a high income skill by investing in yourself, it could be worth the risk. At 40K per year, your time is worth about 20 bucks an hour. So if you're able to find a side hustle that pays at least that, that's going to be a pretty good thing. All right, let me know what you guys think in the comments and I'll answer any questions.

Video Transcript: So the other day I was checking my investment account and I received $12.60 from Coca-Cola as a dividend. That's a percentage of profits that Coke passes back to me every quarter just for owning their shares. Now, I realized that there are a few reasons Coke does this. They're a dividend king, which means that they've been paying dividends for at least 50 years. And in Coke's case, they're going on 62. Paying a dividend is also a conscious decision that shows to the market that they are a stable company because they have enough profits to pass back to their holders. And it is said that Coca-Cola is one of the best defensive companies to own during recessions and bear markets because people are going to drink Coca-Cola no matter the economic environment. But the story doesn't end there because Coca-Cola is owned by a lot of big investors for the passive income in dividends it provides. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, for example, now owns roughly 9% of Coca-Cola, which pays them approximately $815 million every single year in dividends. But if you or I wanted to make just $100 a month from Coke in dividends, well, you would need about 588 shares or about $42,402 worth of Coca-Cola stock. So those dividends do come at a hefty price.

Video Description: These 4 moves built me 80% of my wealth: 💰 #1: PAY YOURSELF FIRST. When my paycheck hits, money immediately goes to investments before I can spend it. Setting aside even $200-300 per paycheck consistently is how wealth actually happens. ⏳ #2: START INVESTING EARLY. As Charlie Munger wisely said, “The big money isn’t in buying or selling, but in waiting.” Compounding needs TIME - the longer your money works, the harder it works for you. 📊 #3: TRACK YOUR NET WORTH MONTHLY. Just like weighing yourself during a fitness journey, I write down all account balances minus debts every month. This mindfulness keeps me focused on progress and growth. 💼 #4: INCREASE YOUR INCOME. While you can build wealth on any salary, earning more while keeping expenses low is the ultimate wealth accelerator. Which of these are you already doing? Drop a 💬 below!

Video Transcript: After 12 years of trying different financial moves, here are the four that built me 80% of my wealth. Number one was paying myself first. So this means that every time I got paid, I would first set aside some money for my future self that would go towards investing or savings. So let's say I had a paycheck of $2,000. I would set aside 300 or 200 bucks of that and just make sure that it got invested because it's really in the consistent investing and savings that you are going to build wealth. Number two is just investing as early as you can. I think Charlie Munger said that the big money is not in the buying or the selling, but rather in the waiting. And that's absolutely true because of compounding. You need your time to compound and the longer time that you have, the better that it compounds. So over 12 years, I can do a lot. Number three was simply tracking my net worth at the end of every month. So I would just write down all my balances of my bank accounts and investment accounts and then subtract any debt that I had. And I think keeping track of your net worth like this is a really good thing. Just like if you're trying to lose weight at the gym, keeping track of your weight means that you're probably gonna be focused on what your progress is looking like and you're gonna be more mindful of everything that's going on with your weight, but in the money analogy, with your money. And number four is simply trying to make more money. While you can become a millionaire on a low salary, it's gonna really accelerate your wealth if you can make more income and keep your expenses low. Let me know what you guys think in the comments.

Video Transcript: Here are four money habits keeping you poor. And if you wanna be rich, you wanna make sure to avoid these. Number one is paying for status. So in modern society, everyone wants to show how much status they have by driving a fancy car or buying designer clothes. But the problem is that most people can't afford it. The average car payment to these days in America is now $742 per month. Number two is being cheap. So I know that this sounds counterintuitive, but sometimes being cheap with certain items will cost you more money in the long run. I'd rather buy one high quality item once instead of buying cheap items again and again. Number three, trying to keep up with your friends. Your financial journey is unique to you, so don't feel pressured to match your friend's spending. When I was making around 50K per year, my friend would always invite me to these lavish Michelin star dinners, and that was just unsustainable. If they are a true friend, they will understand if you say to them that you're not willing to splurge on the same things that they might wanna spend their money on. Before we get into number four, if you wanna get better with your finances, I suggest hitting that follow button so that you can get more videos like this. Number four is paying the minimum on a credit card, because if you do this, you are going to cost yourself a lot more in the long run due to a credit card's high interest rate.

Video Transcript: I want to sell this investment property. It's gone up a million dollars in value since I've bought it. Yeah, but then you would owe capital gains taxes of around 200k. Isn't there like a tax loophole I could take advantage of? You could do a 1031 exchange. That's where you swap your property for a new one and postpone paying taxes on that gain. Okay, so it says here that if I can identify a property within 45 days, close on it within 180 days, I can do this and postpone taxes. Yeah, and the best part is you can postpone taxes indefinitely all the way until you die. What happens when I die then? The original value of the property resets to the market value for your heirs, and they'll owe no capital gains taxes on it. Damn, that's one way to avoid taxes.

Video Transcript: What should I invest my $100 a month in to be a millionaire by 65? I am 27, I'll be 28 in September this year. At age 27, assuming you start with $0, investing $100 per month until 65, you actually need a 13% return in order to become a millionaire. That return isn't easily achievable though because the stock market, for example, averages eight to 10% per year. So investing $100 per month at 8% return only gets you $285,000 by the time you turn 65. Here's how much you need to invest per month at an 8% return and the ending balances by 65. If you have around 38 years left until retirement, $500 per month is needed to become a millionaire. In terms of what to invest in, an S&P 500 ETF like VOO has actually averaged around eight to 10% returns since 1957. And look at how much of your ending balance is compared to what you actually put in. For example, investing $500 per month by the time you're 65, you contributed $228,000 total, but your profits are about 1.2 million. So start early, invest consistently, and a bonus is to invest within a Roth IRA where all your capital gains are tax-free. If you like videos on growing your money, follow for more.

Video Transcript: If you wanna buy this new Audi Q4, it'll cost you $62,625. But once you drive it off the lot, it'll be worth a lot less. After just one minute, it'll be worth 57,326. And after one year, it'll be worth even less. Why is that? Cars are depreciating assets, which means that they lose their value over time. But that still doesn't answer why they lose close to 10% of their value after one singular minute. That has to do with the car's markup. The dealer is buying the car for 57,326, and then they're selling it to you for 62,675. That markup includes overhead costs, interest and marketing expenses, and it also gives the dealership a little bit of profit and wiggle room for negotiation. Once you drive it, though, the markup is basically erased. And if you were to try to sell it back to the dealer, they would maybe be willing to buy it back at the wholesale price, but not likely. To get the most value when buying a car, you wanna buy a car in the depreciation curve's sweet spot. That usually is a car that's three to four years old, where most of the depreciation has been chipped away already, but the car still operates like it's new.

Video Transcript: I found out that if you pay rent, you can earn points that can be applied to your student loans. There's a $1.77 trillion student debt crisis in America, so the ability to help reduce that debt with points you earn from your rent feels like a no-brainer. So the way this works is that you first sign up for BILT, that's the rewards program that lets you earn points on paying rent, among other benefits. Every time you pay your rent through BILT, you earn BILT points, which can be used for travel, fitness classes, ride shares, et cetera. And the biggest update is that you can now redeem BILT points directly toward your eligible student loans across major loan servicers like Nelnet, Mohella, Sallie Mae, and more. There's zero cost to join, and just by paying rent as you normally would, you get valuable and flexible points that can be put toward other major expenses. Another reason to check out BILT if you haven't already.

Video Transcript: If you wanna profit during a recession, try dollar cost averaging and here's why it's so powerful. So here are two different stock charts. Most of us would prefer this one because it starts at $20 per share and then it kind of gradually rises up into the right. The second chart on the other hand, it starts at $20 per share and then the next month it trades at 30, then 40, but then it just has a dramatic dip and crater and then it recovers at the end, yes, but this stock chart is really ugly. So let's say we want a dollar cost average $240 per month into the stock market. In this particular chart, that means you'll get 12 shares in the first month because 240 divided by 20 is 12 shares. Then in the second month, you'll get eight, third month you'll get eight, so on and so forth. And as you can see, the bottom X-axis here is how many shares you will get. Here's where it gets interesting. If you're investing $240 per month without emotions, AKA dollar cost averaging, this chart actually works better for you because during this dip right here, you're picking up 24 shares, 24 shares, 24 shares during this dip when it's trading at $10 per share. In both of these situations, you would have invested $2,400, but look at what happens at the end, 62 shares at $60. That's what it's trading for. Your total investment is now worth $3,720. In the second scenario, you actually picked up way more shares, 142 shares. And since they're trading at $30 now, your total investment is now worth $4,260, even though this chart is way uglier. So the point is really simple. You wanna take emotions out of investing. And if you're investing for the longterm, this will help you profit way more because you aren't gonna be second-guessing dips and buying tops when you get emotional. And I hope this helps.

Video Transcript: This is the best credit card for buying groceries or eating out at restaurants, especially if you're making around $70,000 or more per year. The American Express Gold Card has a $325 annual fee, but it's still probably my favorite overall credit card because of its crazy perks. First, you get four credit card points for every dollar you spend on food, which is the equivalent of about 4% cash back in value. And you also get three X points whenever you book a flight with it. Second, you can make up the cost of the annual fee by using their $120 dining credit, their $120 Uber Cash credit, their $100 Rezzy credit, and the $84 Dunkin' Donuts credit. I also get a $100 credit at a hotel where I book two nights or more through the American Express Hotel Collection website. You can use that credit on room service, for example, and you also get to check in as early as 12 p.m. and check out as late as 4 p.m. Third, you can usually get an intro offer of 60,000 bonus points when you spend $6,000 in the first six months, which is the equivalent of about 10% cash back. It's been the card I use the most in the past few years, and I personally am able to get more value out of the card than it costs me.

Video Transcript: If you're expecting a tax refund this year, please do not do these three things with it. The average tax refund in the US is now $3,116, and many Americans like you or me will look at this sum and spend it on very, very dumb things. So number one, do not use your tax refund on a new car. Interest rates are incredibly high, averaging 6.35% for new cars and 11.62% for used cars. While spending your tax refund on a down payment for a car may sound tempting, you will be stuck with a car payment for the next five to six years on a depreciating asset, and with the average car payment being $737 on a new car in 2025, it's definitely a wealth killer you need to avoid. Number two, please do not open a savings account at your normal bank. Many people will open a savings account for their tax refund, but because that money is very accessible at your current bank, you will be tempted to spend it any chance you get. Instead, open a savings account at a different bank to increase the friction of accessing that money. Now, the next thing to avoid is a very common purchase, and if you follow me, you know to avoid this thing, and that simply is buying new or luxury clothing because that's a type of purchase that does not hold its value.

Video Transcript: Did you know that you can get in trouble if you deposit too much money? That's because any deposit over $10,000 gets flagged by banks, and they will have to report it to the federal government. So people knowing this try to irrationally get around it. They'll make say three separate $8,000 deposits, which is under the 10K limit, but that's actually an illegal practice. It's called structuring, and it's a pattern that money launderers engage in to try to clean their dirty money. If a bank suspects you of this, they are legally required to file a suspicious activity report, which in turn means that you could face consequences. Like the freezing of your accounts, getting subpoenaed, or just getting contacted by law enforcement. Nobody wants that. So what do you do then if you have 25K in cash that you want to deposit? Well, first, you'd probably follow me on social media, but the second is that you simply just deposit the money. The bank will fill out a currency transaction report, and you must be prepared to explain the source of funding. But as long as you did nothing wrong, nothing will happen to you.

Video Transcript: If you ever get sent to jail, the judge might set your bail at $100,000, but 99% of people don't get how bail works. It's not like if you just post the 100K bail, you're suddenly excused of the crime. Posting bail simply affords you the freedom to leave jail on the condition that you return on your court date. Now, what happens when you actually show up to court? That's the most misunderstood part. You see, bail is usually set at an amount that is high enough to ensure that you return to court, but not so crazy that it's impossible for your finances. Still, many people won't have enough money for bail, so they'll resort to getting a bail bond. That's where a bail bond business will loan you 90% of the bail amount while you put up 10% of the bail amount, plus some collateral. Then, when you finally show up for your court date, you actually get your full bail amount back. If you used a bail bond business, you repay them what you borrowed, but then they also get to keep 10% of the bail as a service charge. Moral of the story, don't go to jail.

Video Transcript: The stock market is now officially down over 15% in the past three trading days due to the reciprocal tariffs. There's a lot of uncertainty and volatility right now, so what should you be doing in times like these? I have three action items. Number one, don't get emotional. If you're a passive investor with a 401k, IRA, index funds, and you're investing for the longterm, this is not the time to be panic selling. I personally know a lot of people that sold during the COVID crash, and they basically regretted it because the market recovered within two or three months, and they missed out on a ton of gains. If you're investing for the longterm, there's a very probable chance that the market is going to be way higher later on, so you just wanna stay the course. Number two, if you do wanna buy into the market, make sure to average into it. So perhaps you choose certain levels, like if the S&P 500 hits 5,000, 4,800, 4,600, or 4,400, you can average in that way. Or the simplest way to average in and without the regret of buying too high or too low is just to average in every certain number of days or weeks. And number three, it can be really tough looking at your portfolio every day, so you just really wanna focus on your main source of income and don't lose sight of that.

Video Transcript: I have a friend who made $75,000 streaming video games last year, and she calls me and she had no idea how to file her taxes since it's her first year of making that much money. Because it was last minute, an accountant quoted her $800 just to help her file her taxes. So instead, I think a really good tax prep software that people are still sleeping on is TaxAct, especially if you're doing taxes under a time crunch, TaxAct makes it super easy to file. TaxAct was founded in 1998 and has solutions for every tax situation. So whether you're a student, a property owner with rental income, or a self-employed contractor, they have you covered. TaxAct accuracy is guaranteed and they also guarantee your maximum refund. You won't find a bigger refund with any other tax filing software. Not only that, if you ever do get stuck, they have 100% US-based credentialed tax experts and they're ready to help by phone or over chat. So that means you are talking to actual CPAs, EAs, or tax attorneys, and that's definitely a huge advantage. I told my friend about all this and she was relieved that she could get her taxes over with and that filing taxes doesn't have to be hard. If you're interested, check out TaxAct today.

Video Transcript: This is how much money you need to make $100 a month in dividends with Coca-Cola stock. Coca-Cola right now pays a 2.89% dividend yield. Now this is on a yearly basis. So we need to multiply our $100 a month by 12 to get $1,200 per year. Then you would divide 1200 by 0.0289. That's the dividend yield. And when you do that, you realize you need $41,522 worth of Coca-Cola stock in order to make $100 a month. And that's about 593 shares.

Video Transcript: Hey, what's up? I was wondering if I could sell my gold bar today. Yeah, let's do it. Last year, I bought this one ounce gold bar for 23.59 from Costco. And today I'm gonna go sell it and I'm gonna take you with me. So this is Witter Coin. And when it comes to selling one of these, you can go to any local coin shop and you should be able to get spot price for it. Let's see what we get. So right now we're paying 29.55. So spot price was like 30.20 and you guys do a little bit off spot, right? Yeah, we work on about, you can see our spread. It's the $130 spread between what we're buying them for and what we're selling them for. Okay, but still like two or 3% off. Yeah. That's not bad, cool. Yeah, I'm down, let's do cash. What do you need from me? I just need an ID from you. Okay, there you go. I'm right here. Yeah, how many people are selling like gold bars to you right now?

On an average day, how many people are coming to sell like, sell one of these? Like- For the one ounce bars? Yeah. I would say we probably buy, I don't know, between five and 10 a day.

Video Transcript: Lottery jackpots have gotten out of control and there's a mathematical explanation as to why they've gone so large in the past five-ish years. Out of the top 10 Powerball and Mega Millions jackpots, nine out of 10 of them came in the last five years and it's all due to a change that the lottery operators made. Because larger jackpots attract more people to play and more players means more revenue for the operators and the states, they realized that if they changed the number matrix that it would result in big jackpots. For the Powerball, previously you had to choose between one and 59 for the white balls and then there were 35 Powerballs to choose from. This made the odds one in 175 million to win. But then they changed it. You now had to choose five numbers between one and 69 for the white balls and they decreased the number of Powerballs to choose from to 26. That's fewer Powerballs, yes, but this effectively made the odds way worse. It's one in 292 million now will win. Obviously, people like to rationalize that if they buy more tickets, it increases their odds of winning, but let me show you how grim the odds are even if you buy 10 tickets or $20 worth. If you buy one ticket, your chances of losing are 0.99999999660. And if you buy 10 tickets, well, you can see right here, it doesn't really change that much in terms of the decimal places. With that being said, are you still gonna play and just disregard everything in this video? Let me know in the comments.

Video Transcript: Margot, you're fantastically set up for retirement. You've built up a seven-figure portfolio, and one of your biggest holdings, around a quarter of that, is Berkshire Hathaway. Now, tell us why you picked that and a bit about what this stock is. So, it's a firm that's run by an investor called Warren Buffett. Yep, I think we've heard of him. What I like about the investment philosophy is just the idea of looking for businesses that have inherent value. I think that Warren Buffett and his investment partners have done very well in finding those businesses. But I sense a but is coming. I had been concerned for some time about having such a big exposure to the Berkshire Hathaway position. That investment model seems to have found its ceiling. Now, Buffett fans will know that a record level of Berkshire's portfolio is held in cash or bonds, nearly a quarter of its overall value at the last count, as Warren Buffett trims his equity holdings. Plus, he hasn't made any big acquisitions recently, and he's 94 years old. I mean, how does that make you feel as an investor who's held Berkshire Hathaway for many, many years? Yeah, I mean, breaking those two questions down separately, I think maybe the first one's possibly the more important one, i.e. the fact that there's a huge cash pile. That's because he's, my impression is, he and the people he's trained around him are very disciplined in their investment decisions. And they're not going to invest just because they've got a huge cash pile. They're going to invest if they find the right opportunities. And so maybe this tells us it's another information point that says... That US stocks are overvalued? For example, and the fact that he can't find solid domestic businesses to invest in and so on.

Video Description: Last month, Robert Armstrong coined the acronym 'Taco' — which stands for 'Trump always chickens out' — as a way to describe the US president's tariff approach and the way markets react to it. After a reporter asked the US president about it at a White House press conference on Wednesday, Trump criticized the term and said he's not 'chickening out' on trade.

Video Transcript: One version of the taco trade thesis is just, Trump says crazy thing, market go down, two days later, Trump takes it back, market go up. And this has been 100% true, by the way. And I mean, it may not work now, maybe this idea that the boy who cried wolf situation becomes now, market will respond less. But the market doesn't seem to be in on the gag, at least up until this point, which is weird and which is the reason that we kind of coined the term in the first place. That's sort of the point I was making around, will the taco trade eat itself, right? So we've had- Yes. Is it over now? Is the taco trade over now? Let's say it is. Yeah. I sort of hope so, but I don't know. I think if the stock market didn't learn the first four times, like on the fifth time, is the market really going to act differently? Yeah. I don't expect so. We've had lots of emails from readers and listeners about the taco trade. Some of them are saying, lol. Some of them are saying, wow, congrats. And some of them are saying, if Donald Trump lashes out here and does something radical just to annoy the nasty haters and losers, it's all Rob Armstrong's fault. There is a horrible, an extremely unlikely, but horrible timeline in which I've just caused a worldwide recession by making a dumb joke.

Video Transcript: From food delivery to fast fashion, the option to buy now, pay later, is everywhere. Companies like Klarna and Clearpay are letting more and more customers split their purchases into installments without charging interest. But did you know that this type of lending is currently unregulated in the UK? This means that the companies offering these loans do not have to check if consumers can afford them. It also means that borrowers are unable to make complaints to the ombudsman, like they can do with their banks. That's why the UK Labour government is changing this with new legislation which they are bringing forward to regulate the sector. It has been nearly four years since the previous Conservative government first announced plans to do it, so these rules have been long awaited. The government described it as putting an end to the wild west of buy now, pay later, or BNPL. It's good news for consumer groups who have for years criticised these companies, saying they put vulnerable people at risk of accumulating debt from different providers and being hit with late repayment fees. Companies like Klarna have publicly welcomed the rules, saying they will bring clarity and trust that will be good for business. After intense lobbying, they got a big win from the government, which is the fact that they will get a bespoke regime around the disclosures they have to make to customers before they take out a loan. This means they will get their own user-friendly disclosure rules instead of the clunkier ones that were designed 50 years ago under the Consumer Credit Act. Even though consumer groups say affordability checks will help protect consumers, there are still questions around whether people should be using these loans for small everyday purchases if they can't afford them. Now that the government has brought this to Parliament, financial regulators have a year to come up with the detail.

Video Transcript: Multinational companies are borrowing in renminbi at a record rate, as they search for cheaper funding and a way to hedge against US-China relations. Panda bond issuance is renminbi borrowing by overseas companies in the mainland. In 2024, total borrowing was almost 200 billion renminbi, which is the highest on record. In the first quarter of this year, panda bond issuance was more than 40 billion renminbi, the second highest quarter on record. This marks a shift in strategy by global companies to raise debt for their Chinese subsidiaries locally. It was also boosted by Chinese authorities allowing companies to transfer funds raised from panda bonds outside of mainland China. Analysts say this so-called in-China, for-China strategy can help companies reduce transaction costs and hedge against potential financial restrictions if US-China tensions escalate further. Some international organizations and foreign governments like Hungary have also issued panda bonds.

Video Transcript: So the bonds have weakened, and as you say, four and a half or so on the 10-year, I'm sure we can live with that, but there's something about... We can, and it should be said that's within the kind of long-term trading range that goes back to 22. But as with so many financial variables, what matters is less the level than the direction of change. Yes. And the direction of change is up for yields, down for bond prices. Also, one level that does sort of matter to people, there is something about the number five that really sticks in bond markets' heads. And the 30-year US Treasury bond is trading with a yield of about 5%. And that tends to be getting close to what people sometimes call the danger zone. And it's not difficult to imagine that at a certain point pretty soon, lots of investors will start saying, hang on, why do I want to be buying stocks when I don't know what's going to happen next, when I could just buy this Treasury bond and Uncle Sam is going to pay me back one day with a yield of 5%? And it's a yield of 5%. And let's say we expect inflation to be about 3% for the next 30 years. That means you're just collecting 2% a year in real terms from the US government. Yeah, just by buying the bond. You don't have to, just by buying the bond. Yeah, at a certain point, the bonds just get too, just too good to turn down.

Video Transcript: Could the dollar cease to be the world's dominant currency? The dollar has in fact been in this position for at least 100 years since it replaced the pound sterling. But today people are beginning to ask quite serious questions whether this will continue. The crucial thing to remember is that the dollar's strength is based on very profound advantages. The United States is still the biggest economy in the world. It has open and liquid capital markets. The currency is as a result widely used in trade and finance across the world. People want to use it because everybody else uses it. So how could that change? Well one reason would be that people start thinking the dollar is really being seriously mismanaged. The trade policy of the United States looks pretty frightening right now. Lots of people are worried about that. The fiscal policy is also worrying. The debt ratio, the ratio of public debt to GDP is exploding. All these are reasons why people worry about the dollar. But at the same time, what's the alternative? Well the most obvious one is the euro. But the euro is at the moment much less significant. It doesn't have a liquid deep capital market. There are no eurozone bonds. They're national bonds. Each of those markets are much smaller than America's. It isn't a political union. The alternative is China, which definitely is a powerful economy. But the problem with China is that it has capital controls. The markets are not deep and liquid. They're not accessible for most people in the world. So in the end, the conclusion is simple. The dollar is not as strong as it used to be, but it's better than all the others.

Video Transcript: So it is possible that there will be a mega deal that may even address some of the structural issues that were problems under your time. Do you think that's the most likely scenario? What do you think is going to happen? I think the Chinese have shown, even relative to other countries, that they very much do not want to be seen as caving in to President Trump. I think they were one of the only countries that did any retaliation to the tariffs that were announced in April. They, as I said before, have been very focused on making sure they are ready for a fight like this, if need be. President Xi is very adamant that China is itself a great power and they are not going to be bullied. So I think that may make it hard to reach something that looks like a grand bargain, if just because it's not clear China wants to be seen as crafting a great bargain. I do think a baseline tariff is going to always be there. I think the Trump administration, unlike the first Trump administration, is very focused on the revenue they get from tariffs. And that's one reason you're seeing that baseline of 10 percent against everyone. I think there will probably be some attempt to climb down and there will be basically some window dressing. At the same time, over time, there might be progress on the Chinese side, just because, as I said before, there are things that really are in China's interest. And so I think China will take steps in those directions. I do think some sort of purchase agreement where the president can argue he has cut a deal, I think, is quite likely.

Video Transcript: Yes, Keir Starmer finally signed the deal on Thursday to hand over sovereignty over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius after years of diplomacy. But also, Keir Starmer pointed out at the press conference at Northwood, the command base where he announced this deal, that it had the blessing, of course, of the Five Eyes partners and the security partnership. So Britain, the States, Canada, New Zealand and Australia all endorsed it. And then he made the point quite contentiously that the countries that opposed it were notably China, Russia and Iran. And he said it was surprising that Cammy Badenock should find herself in the same column as those countries. What did you make of that comment, Miranda? I think he couldn't resist a dig at her on that comment. He's quite enjoying drawing attention to the fact that opposing the Starmer government is putting her in weird positions for a Tory party. I've got her comments here in response to what Keir Starmer said. She said it speaks volumes about this shameful prime minister that he attacks me instead of owning up to another wrongheaded, wasteful and dangerous deal. Peter, do you think she's finding herself on the wrong side of some quite big arguments here? Keir Starmer's lots of things. He's stodgy. He's boring. He's a terrible performer. Shameful? You know, I don't know. I just feel like, you know, Keir Starmer's not that kind of prime minister. And it all feels kind of very hyperbolic and over-egged and slightly desperate. I guess maybe in that particular, you know, rah-rah, you know, wave the union flag, bring back the glories of the Falklands and, you know, that very stereotypical view of what a Conservative voter, you know, believes in, she thinks maybe she's touching those buttons. It feels rather off-key to me. I just wonder whether it's sort of a bit like me listening to Absolute Radio 90s, whether it's just going back to the familiar old tunes, which maybe don't sound quite so good anymore. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

Video Transcript: So Jane, you're about to celebrate a big birthday, and that's been making you think about the future. I'm nearly 50, and I have about $125,000 in savings, cash savings. And I'm kind of wondering whether or not it's too late to start investing. Well, you've done really well to save up that much money. I've always been conscious about saving money each month. I've always just felt safer having the money in savings accounts rather than investing it and knowing that there could be risks. Well, sure. I'm just really risk averse, Claire. I'm not going to lie. Well, sure, and Trump's tariffs means that these are volatile times for investors. But over the long term, inflation eroding the spending power of your cash is another risk. I could probably make a lot more money if I weathered the storm with investing than in my savings accounts. And I feel as if if I'm going to try and work to at least I'm 60, if not more, I need to try and make the most of these next 10 years or 15 years before I possibly think about retiring to maximise the cash that I've got. Well, you're right to be cautious about jumping in and investing a large lump sum in one go. I mean, that's going from one extreme to another, but reallocating some of that cash bit by bit into investments is something that you could consider. But Jane, can I ask, do you pay into a workplace pension? Yeah, not an awful lot. So I have just recently increased my contributions each month into that pension scheme. Well, that's great. I mean, pensions are a very tax efficient way of investing money. And that's an investment decision that you've made after learning more about your options. So I hope it gives you the confidence that it's never too late.

Video Transcript: Astronomers have discovered what could be signs of life on planet K218b. The obvious question, how do you position your investment portfolio for the day that the aliens come calling? Okay, step one, safe havens. Forget gold, it's already too expensive. Treasury bonds, obviously put those in your portfolio, but really think pandemic era safe haven assets, toilet paper, makers of toilet paper, Procter & Gamble, Kimberly-Clark, Philly Boots. Number two, assume that the aliens are not going to love humans, because who would, and buy defence stocks. RTX, Lockheed Martin, also defence tech company Palantir. Management of Palantir already speaks like aliens, no one knows what the company does, but you should buy shares in it immediately if you think the aliens are going to visit. Number three, consumer goods. Planet K218b potentially has enough space to sustain 56 billion life forms. That's an awful lot of mouths in need of toothbrushes, armpits in need of deodorant, and shoulders in need of fancy handbags. So you're going to want to buy companies like Colgate, LVMH, Unilever, companies that haven't seen a market this big open up since China entered the world economy in 2001. Now in seriousness, if the aliens really do arrive, it's going to have all kinds of impact on investments that previously people thought reflected fringe bets on technologies that may never come to pass. Things like quantum computing, Tesla's humanoid robots. If aliens can find us from across the universe, then anything is possible, and some of these fringe trades will start to become mainstream. We used to talk about the black swan trade after the financial crisis, meaning things that were very unlikely to happen, but sometimes do. It's time instead to start thinking about the little green swan.

Video Transcript: the EU still has to somehow figure out how it's going to respond to Trump, how do you think they should? I'd make the point that for those collection of democracies, to act collectively is the best way of dealing with this challenge and to allocate competence of that to one institution is the most effective way of doing that. And yes, it can therefore mean that we need to spend a longer period of time building up consensus then regarding how we act. But we do, and we are, want to engage with the US on that and see can we create that deal. But the way that Trump seems to like to act is very kind of impulsive, one-on-one, and the EU just can't respond in that way because you've got to go back to Brussels and get consensus of 27 people and so on. But agility isn't always the same thing as speed. Some of the time it is, some of the time it's not. And from the engagement that I'm having with the Commission at the moment and the work that I know they're doing with other Member States, if you do want an agreement, which I hope and believe the US wants, I think it's in our interest to have an agreement that can be durable and that can stand the test of time. And the EU does have the ability to do that. And you are right, it could take a little bit more time because we are a collection of countries as opposed to a single country. Then the economic value of that agreement is far bigger.

Video Transcript: Why are people talking about security threats in the Arctic? Even before his inauguration, Donald Trump put the Arctic on the global agenda when he restated his desire to buy Greenland, a territory which belongs to the US's NATO ally, Denmark. The US space base on Greenland is a key part of its early warning system to detect Russian long-range missiles, so the president wants to boost defences there. The reason for increased concern is that Moscow has reopened a string of Cold War military bases along its northern coast, where its most sensitive nuclear assets are stored. Its submarines are venturing down to the Atlantic within range of European capitals in greater numbers, and tensions with NATO countries are rising as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine three years ago. Moscow and Beijing are also investing in a new maritime passage, the Northern Sea Route, which will cut the journey time between Asia and Europe. This critical route is becoming more accessible as Arctic ice melts. So does this mean there will be war in the Arctic? No, not necessarily. But the race between superpowers to access minerals buried under the ice and to navigate the Northern Sea Route has sparked a competition for control. Conflict might not start in the Arctic, but it could easily spread to this region from elsewhere in Europe. What is clear is that Russia tests many of its most advanced weapons in Arctic waters and is also trying out its so-called hybrid warfare capabilities in northern Norway, high in the Arctic Circle. These actions, such as cutting cables and jamming aircraft GPS, fall beneath the threshold of formal armed conflict. But they signal rising hostility between Russia and the West.

Video Transcript: I just think it's going to be interesting to see the incredibly methodical, serious trade talk pro-Europeans in a room with whoever it is that the US puts forward. Maybe it's Peter Nabarro, maybe it's Scott Besson, the Treasury Secretary, who knows? Indeed, and if there's any weakness that the EU has, I think it's that they're assuming they're dealing with a more rational interlocutor. One thing I know that EU people have said is they've assembled this list of retaliation and it's done the traditional way people do retaliation, which is you choose products which are going to hurt politically. In the US, that means you go after particular products from particular states. They always used to go after bourbon because that was Kentucky, because that was Mitch McConnell who was Senate leader for a long time. I think this time they've said they're going to go after soybeans because that's Mike Johnson, who's from Louisiana, and soybeans from Louisiana. The problem with this, I think, is I'm not sure Trump really cares what anyone in Congress thinks. He's making trade policy from the hip using these emergency powers and completely ignoring anything that anyone in Congress says. On his nice new plane from Qatar. On his nice new plane. So is he really going to sit there going, oh no, the soybean farmers of Louisiana are slightly angry. I had better stop my trade war. That seems to me slightly improbable. So I'm not convinced the EU is on the right track if it's trying to use the old playbook on that. I'm not convinced the EU is on the right track if it's trying to use the old playbook

Video Transcript: I see why the Bank of England has a trade economist on its Monetary Policy Committee. Could the Trump administration learn anything from a trade economist based in the UK, perhaps based on some recent experiences over the last decade or so? I think we should always learn from big episodes for the reason that they don't happen very frequently and I think the UK's experience with Brexit and how that panned out over the years is really instructive in that regard because we don't have many other examples of when developed countries put on trade barriers with their key trading partners. And I think what we learned from that episode was, you know, one, the effects can be felt fairly quickly. So the sterling depreciation that happened, it happened within a matter of minutes of when the Sunderland vote came out and sterling lost its value by 10% from subsequent years. That, of course, translated into higher import prices for the UK, both for businesses as well as for consumers. As a result of that, we had a three-year period in the UK from about 2017 to 2019 when real wages almost did not grow at all. So I think the key lesson here is that, you know, it's very attractive before it's happened to think that you would be able to reorient, remake yourself, change your position in the world economy. When the time comes, the performance need not be quite as sanguine. Well, I am sure President Donald Trump is taking detailed notes.

Video Transcript: So Rana, let's start with you. What's with this appeal to the left? I mean, as best as you can tell, why are we seeing it now? Well, I think the fact that his poll numbers have been so low, the fact that we've just come through the aftermath of Liberation Day, people are completely freaked out about markets, although they're up, they don't know that they're gonna stay there. There've been some concerns about inflation, just the fact that you have this sort of new normal of 10% tariffs, even if they're being lowered as they were just in this recent US-China deal from triple digits, 10% is huge. That is huge. That's a sea change that's gonna ripple through the economy for months, years, even decades, because tariffs tend to be quite difficult to get off once they're on. So a lot of people are feeling insecure. And so one thing I will say about Donald Trump that I admire is his animal-like instinct to understand where fear is, where anxiety is, and that is where he gravitates.

Video Transcript: We're spending less cash, but we're hoarding more banknotes than ever before. Data from the Bank of England shows the value of banknotes in circulation has never been higher, even though less cash is being spent as card, contactless and mobile payments continue to soar in popularity. With the tax burden at a 70 year high, is this evidence of Britain's hidden cash economy? As more businesses refuse to accept cash, are households hoarding cash that they cannot spend? Or are people deliberately stashing cash away as a store of value? The Bank of England reckons 60% of households do this, noting the comfort of holding cash in troubled times. But as bank branches and cash points vanish, it's harder to get your hands on your money. And as recent power cuts and cyber attacks on retailers have shown, we still need cash as a backup. So what kind of cash payments are going under the radar? Well, babysitters, cleaners, gardeners, tutors, all commonly paid in cash. The same goes for haircuts, nails, beauty treatments, getting the car washed. And if you're having any kind of work done in your home, you might expect a discount for paying in cash. Then there's illegal substances, where I'm guessing the anonymity of cash is something that both parties value. One and a half million people in Britain say they use cash on a day-to-day basis. They tend to be older, poorer and living in rural areas. But even if you're among the 22 million who use cash once a month or less, here's a penny for your thoughts. Would you still want cash to vanish completely?

Video Transcript: Japanese anime has shifted over the years from something niche to a global phenomenon, one of Japan's most potent vectors of soft power. Naruto, Dragon Ball Z, Pokemon, Akira and a galaxy of others have become touchstones of culture for 800 million fans worldwide, including sports stars, musicians and even politicians. International studios and investors have seen the appeal of its extensive back catalogue of characters and plotlines, and at least two superhero franchises have foundered. The global mark for anime is now expected to almost double from $31.2 billion in 2023 to around $60 billion by 2030. But as the popularity of anime grows, Japan is increasingly concerned the financial value is disappearing overseas. Japanese studios receive less than 10% of anime-related revenue from abroad, as distributors, streaming platforms and merchandising companies all take a slice of the pie. Illegal downloads, piracy, has also been a massive problem. Companies now want to make more money from products, events and games, but it won't be easy. The government hopes it can throw smart money at the push, while asking trade representatives to take anime as seriously as cars and semiconductors. But some analysts think these initiatives fail to target the sector's real structural issues such as labour shortage and bad working conditions, all of which opens the door to artificial intelligence, which could, in the end, be either a threat or a cure.

Video Transcript: I was, I must say, surprised, without wanting to sound too power-clutching, at the way Keir Starmer presented this. And in particular, the very controversial phrase, this country risks becoming an island of strangers without further curbs on migration, which many people have pointed out has echoes of Enoch Powell's notorious 1968 Rivers of Blood address in which he talked about people becoming strangers in their own country as a result of migration. And to my mind, the much more successful packaging of this would have been to say, look, we are one of the most successful experiments in multiculturalism and immigration in the world. We have people living side by side, this rich melting pot, but the pace, the scale has been too fast, it's been too large, and it's been done by successive governments without the consent of the public. And I just was surprised that he went on this very negative framing of immigration. And unsurprisingly, Reformer Cocker Hoop, Sarah Pochin, the newest Reform MP, saying, oh, he's more Reform than Reform now. I found myself conflicted by the language he used, but I think it's slightly a mistake to view this totally in terms of an election strategy against reform, of course that's in the mix. But fundamentally, what this is is a response to something the public has been saying for a very long time, which is we've been telling you something and you're not doing anything about it. Now, the danger is he ramps up the rhetoric and fails to deliver. But if these measures actually work, I think you can go back to the people on the left who are queasy about this and say, well, look, who would you rather be doing this, me or Nigel Farage? Personally, I'd not have chosen a clause from an Enoch Powell speech, but I sort of see what they're trying to do.

Video Transcript: So the US and the UK have just struck a deal to get past the initial tariffs that were imposed or threatened by Donald Trump. What are the risks of the approach that both the US and the UK are taking with this deal? Well, if you think about it on a global scale, we have a system of global rules embodied in the World Trade Organisation going back decades that countries will not discriminate against other countries in terms of the tariffs they impose. So they can have a high tariff or a low tariff, but that has to be the same for everyone who is importing into them or to whom they're exporting, unless there is a comprehensive free trade deal between two countries, in which case they can have lower tariffs. The issue with the UK-US trade deal, not going into the specifics of individual sectors, is that this is not a classic free agreement where they've done a comprehensive deal. But as part of it, the UK has agreed to lower some of its tariffs on imports from America unilaterally. It's not doing the same globally, so other countries will not have those privileges in terms of exporting those products into the UK that the US has. And the danger is, as many analysts have identified, that this is capitulating or conceding the global system in a way which is quite potentially damaging.

Video Transcript: Explain where you think this leaves India-Pakistan relations now. Yeah, so all in all, you know, this very nationalist kind of a political environment, the social media pressure, the employment of newer defence technologies, a higher confrontational base means that the next time on the escalation ladder, Indians would be actually, India and Pakistan would be starting at a much higher run. So that to me means that, you know, the nuclear run that remains much closer to arriving in that sense. So the crisis will be much faster, much bigger, and much sharper. That is what my big worry from this crisis is. So the resolution of the crisis essentially has not reset in any way. It has only frozen the crisis at this level, and the next crisis would actually start from this run, not at something, you know, which had been resolved and gone down and normal diplomatic ties had been established. That's a big worry, big concern, and a big risk for South Asia, because these are both nuclear weapon states.

Video Transcript: It's possible that markets have really seen how terrible it could be with the reciprocal tariffs. And just any walk back from that horrible extreme is welcome news. Also, I mean, we can even think back to his campaign promises. Originally, he said 10 percent around the world, 60 percent on China. Yes. We're below that. Or we're at or below that. Yes. With the potential to go lower. Yes. So if anything, this is a big departure or a slight improvement from what he said earliest phase. 20, 20 percent of the 30 percent that's still on China is the fentanyl. Tax. That looks to me to be ripe to remove. Right. That's something that just screams out. Negotiate me away. But now where are we going to wind up with lower tariffs on China than we had going into this administration? Because, you know, remember, we had plenty of tariffs that Trump had put on and then Biden even added to. If China is clever, they will give Trump enough other concessions of various flavors that he can hold up the trophy and declare victory while bringing tariffs down further. Yeah. I mean, we can give China some praise here, too. When Trump first hit them with tariffs in, what, February and January, they chose very targeted, retaliatory tariffs. Right. They were politically meaningful and less economically meaningful. Right. Tariffing coal, which is mostly produced in states that support Trump. Tariffing hyper specific things that theoretically would bring Trump to the table. I don't know if that's actually what brought Trump to the table, but in retrospect, it seems like a good gambit by them.

Video Transcript: It's been a messy few weeks in metals markets, and the latest ructions are playing out in the space for rare earth metals. China announced an export ban on rare earth metals and the magnets that they go into. And this is potentially a really big deal because although rare earth metals are not actually rare, you can find them all over the world and they can be mined in countries all over the place. What is rare is the processing capabilities that are all concentrated primarily in China. What China does is it turns the metals into something that magnet manufacturers can use. And those magnets go into things like wind turbines, electric vehicles, the defense industry, the technology industries. It's really important that countries around the world have secure supply chains of rare earths. And this is exactly the problem at the moment that basically no one does apart from China. How this plays out is a little unclear. They have said that they'll be giving out licenses, so it may not be a total blanket ban. But what is clear is the vulnerability of rare earth supply chains. And this is an issue for countries and companies all over the world. It's not just the US, which is in an escalating trade war with China. It's also countries like Japan and Korea, which import large volumes of rare earths and manufacture magnets. And if countries and companies don't wanna be dependent on one main supplier, China, then they need to build out mines and processing facilities elsewhere. But that can take years. So there's a lot to watch still. For more UN videos visit www.un.org

Video Transcript: I travel a lot by train, and I've noticed one thing, that on-board Wi-Fi almost never works. On services like Eurostar, you can't even get a phone signal half the time. Why is that? Well, one reason is that trains carry lots of bored people who want lots of bandwidth, for example, to stream videos. Another thing is that trains travel really fast, up to 200 miles an hour for a high-speed train. So it makes it more difficult for the train or for your device to stay connected as it jumps from one mobile phone antenna to another. And crucially, mobile phone operators, when they built all their towers, they focused on the areas where people live, like towns and cities, whereas trains, they're going through rural areas. The good news, at least, is that train and telecoms operators think they know the solution, which is basically to build more mobile phone antennas along the train tracks and in tunnels. That's what they're doing, for example, on the London Underground, where you can now get, on some lines, 4G. The problem is, it costs a bit of money. So would you be prepared to pay more for your train ticket if there were working Wi-Fi or mobile phone signal? Oh, and one more thing. Just imagine a carriage full of people listening to Zoom calls and, indeed, streaming music without headphones. Maybe if the Wi-Fi does start working, we'll wish that it didn't.

Instructions
Analyze the provided information and answer the following questions based strictly on the available data. Do not infer or assume any details beyond what is given. Keep responses concise, precise and data-driven."""


tiktok_finfluencer_onboarding_user_prompt = """You will be presented with a series of questions related to the profile of the Tiktok user. Each question is preceded by predefined response options, each labeled with a symbol (e.g. "A1", "A2", "B1", etc.).

For each question, follow these instructions strictly:
1) Select the most likely response based strictly on the provided profile data. The chosen response must be the most accurate representation of the profile.
2) Select only one symbol/category per question. A title, symbol, and category cannot appear more than once in your answer.
3) Present the selected symbol for each question (if applicable) and write out in full the response associated with the selected symbol.
4) For each selected symbol/category, indicate the level of speculation involved in this selection on a scale from 0 (not speculative at all, every single element of the profile data was useful in the selection) to 100 (fully speculative, there is no information related to this question in the profile data). Speculation levels should be a direct measure of the amount of useful information available in the profile and pertain only to the information available in the profile data -- namely the username, name, description, profile picture, and videos from the profile-- and should not be affected by additional information available to you from any other source.

To ensure consistency, use the following guidelines to determine speculation levels:
0-20 (Low speculation): The profile data provides clear and direct information relevant to the question. (e.g., explicit mention in the profile or videos)
21-40 (Moderate-low speculation): The profile data provides indirect but strong indicators relevant to the question. (e.g., context from multiple sources within the profile or videos)
41-60 (Moderate speculation): The profile data provides some hints or partial information relevant to the question. (e.g., inferred from user interests or indirect references)
61-80 (Moderate-high speculation): The profile data provides limited and weak indicators relevant to the question. (e.g., very subtle hints or minimal context)
81-100 (High speculation): The profile data provides no or almost no information relevant to the question. (e.g., assumptions based on very general information)

5) For each selected category, please explain at length what features of the data contributed to your choice and your speculation level.
6) Preserve a strictly structured response format to ensure clarity and ease parsing of the text.
For categorical questions, format your output as follows (this is just an example; do not focus on the specific question, symbol, or category):
**question: How well does the user engage with their audience?**
**explanation: [Detailed reasoning for selection]**
**symbol: A1)**
**category: Very Well**
**speculation: 90**

For numerical questions (0-100 scale), format your output as follows (this is just an example; do not focus on the specific question, symbol, or category):
**question: Indicate on a scale of 0 to 100, how knowledgable is the user about finance (0 means not at all knowledgeable and 100 means very knowledgeable)?**
**explanation: [Detailed reasoning for selection]**
**value: 20**
**speculation: 90**

For open-ended questions, format your output as follows (this is just an example; do not focus on the specific question, symbol, or category):
**question: Are there any stocks you expect to **underperform** or decline in the next 3-6 months?**
**response: [Detailed response]**
**speculation: 90**

YOU MUST GIVE AN ANSWER FOR EVERY QUESTION!

Question 1: Is this a finfluencer?
A1) Yes
A2) No

Question 2: Indicate on a scale of 0 to 100, how influential this influencer is (0 means not at all influential and 100 means very influential with millions of followers and mainstream recognition)? Please consider quantitative thresholds such as follower count and engagement rate when answering this question. For example, a micro-influencer will be in the 20-40 range, whereas an account with hundreds of thousands of followers and high engagement might rate 80+.

Question 3: Indicate on a scale of 0 to 100, how credible or authoritative this influencer is (0 means not at all credible or authoritative and 100 means very credible and authoritative)? For example, an experienced analyst with a solid track record and formal education is considered more credible than an influencer making unverified claims and promoting speculative bets without disclaimers.

Question 4: Which of these areas of finance are the primary focus of the influencer’s posts? Pick the most dominant theme or list two if it is truly split; however, one primary focus is always more preferable.
B1) Stock Trading and Equities: Content centered on stock picks, technical analysis, trading strategies, and market indexes.

Instructions
Answer the following questions based strictly on the available data while maintaining the persona and perspective of the Tiktok financial influencer profile provided. Do not infer or assume any details beyond what is given. Keep responses concise, precise and data-driven."""


tiktok_finfluencer_interview_user_prompt = """You will be presented with a series of questions, each preceded by predefined response options labeled with a symbol (e.g. "A1", "A2", "B1", etc.).

For each question, follow these instructions strictly:
1) Select the most likely response based strictly on the provided profile data. The chosen response must be the most accurate representation of the profile.
2) Select only one symbol/category per question. A title, symbol, and category cannot appear more than once in your answer.
3) Present the selected symbol for each question (if applicable) and write out in full the response associated with the selected symbol.
4) For each selected symbol/category, indicate the level of speculation involved in this selection on a scale from 0 (not speculative at all, every single element of the profile data was useful in the selection) to 100 (fully speculative, there is no information related to this question in the profile data). Speculation levels should be a direct measure of the amount of useful information available in the profile and pertain only to the information available in the profile data -- namely the username, name, description, profile picture, and videos from the profile-- and should not be affected by additional information available to you from any other source.

To ensure consistency, use the following guidelines to determine speculation levels:
0-20 (Low speculation): The profile data provides clear and direct information relevant to the question. (e.g., explicit mention in the profile or videos)
21-40 (Moderate-low speculation): The profile data provides indirect but strong indicators relevant to the question. (e.g., context from multiple sources within the profile or videos)
41-60 (Moderate speculation): The profile data provides some hints or partial information relevant to the question. (e.g., inferred from user interests or indirect references)
61-80 (Moderate-high speculation): The profile data provides limited and weak indicators relevant to the question. (e.g., very subtle hints or minimal context)
81-100 (High speculation): The profile data provides no or almost no information relevant to the question. (e.g., assumptions based on very general information)

5) For each selected category, please explain at length what features of the data contributed to your choice and your speculation level.
6) Preserve a strictly structured response format to ensure clarity and ease parsing of the text.
For categorical questions, format your output as follows (this is just an example; do not focus on the specific question, symbol, or category):
**question: How well does the user engage with their audience?**
**explanation: [Detailed reasoning for selection]**
**symbol: A1)**
**category: Very Well**
**speculation: 90**

For numerical questions (0-100 scale), format your output as follows (this is just an example; do not focus on the specific question, symbol, or category):
**question: Indicate on a scale of 0 to 100, how knowledgable is the user about finance – 0 means not at all knowledgeable and 100 means very knowledgeable?**
**explanation: [Detailed reasoning for selection]**
**value: 20**
**speculation: 90**

For open-ended questions, format your output as follows (this is just an example; do not focus on the specific question, symbol, or category):
**question: Are there any stocks you expect to **underperform** or decline in the next 3-6 months?**
**response: [Detailed response]**
